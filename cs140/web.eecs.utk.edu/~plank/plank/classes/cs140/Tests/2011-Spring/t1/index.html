<h2>Comments</h2>

This is probably the easiest exam I've given in nearly 20 years of teaching.
That said, it did a pretty good job of testing you.  Questions 11 and 12
had a pretty big impact on your score, but that was intentional, since there
was not a huge amount of code reading/writing on the exam.
<p>
The ranges of grades are below.   I am not breaking up grades into "B+" or "A-".
Instead, I simply break them up into ABCD, and use those scores to calculate your
final scores.  When I get the final scores, I will break up the B's into A-/B+/B,
and the C's into B-/C+/C.

<UL>
<LI> A+: 40 to 46
<LI> A: 35 to 40
<LI> B: 30 to 35
<LI> C: 24 to 30
<LI> D: 20 to 24
<LI> F: Below 20

This is a Tukey Plot, which has lines to the max and min, yellow box denoting
the 1st and 3rd quartiles, hash marks at the median, and dot at the mean.

In the <a href="answers.html">"answers and grading"</a>, there are histograms of scores for each question.
