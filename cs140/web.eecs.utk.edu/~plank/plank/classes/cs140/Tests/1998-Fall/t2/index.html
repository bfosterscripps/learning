<h1>General Comments</h1>

This was not an easy exam.  I don't think it was too long -- simply 
broad and it made you think.  Scores ran the gamut, but there were
a few in the 90's, which is very impressive.  Here is my breakdown
of assigning letters to the numbers.
<UL>
<LI> 80 -100: A+
<LI> 65 - 80: A
<LI> 60 - 65: B+
<LI> 50 - 60: B
<LI> 45 - 50: C+
<LI> 35 - 45: C
<LI> 20 - 35: D
<LI> 0 - 20: F
</UL>
