<h1>General Comments</h1>

None really -- this was a typical exam in terms of difficulty.
<p>
I suggest that you go over all of the files above.  In particular, if
you missed <i>any</i> points on a question, you should look at the 
correct answer.
<p>
Look at the histogram files above, and the plots below to get a sense
of how you did in comparison to the rest of the class.

<h1>Assigning Grades</h1>

In assigning grades, I first like to set the basic competence level.
I expected everyone to be able to do the following:
<UL>
<LI> Get three points on question 1.
<LI> Get two points each for questions 2 and 3.   
<LI> Get one point for question 4.
<LI> Get two points each on question 5-7.
<LI> Get two points each on questions 8-13.
<LI> Get at least 15 points on question 14.  That's 8 points for the structure,
     plus 7 random points on the other things.
<LI> Get two points on question 15, and 7 points total on 16-19.
</UL>
That makes 50, which will be set as the B level.

With that in mind, here are the letter grades that I would assign to the test
scores:
<UL>
<LI> 70  to 78: A+
<LI> 64  to 70: A
<LI> 58  to 64: B+
<LI> 50  to 58: B
<LI> 46  to 50: C+
<LI> 38  to 46: C
<LI> 30  to 38: D
<LI> Under 30: F
</UL>
