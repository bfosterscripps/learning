<hr><h2>Question 1: 13 Points</h2>

Since the queue is FIFO, the <b>q.Pop()</b> statement removes <b>Dub</b> from the queue.
You are left with a two element queue.  I will not explain the structure here.  Read the
lecture notes on queue implementation for an explanation.  <b>Part A:</b>

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src="Q1-A.jpg"></td></table></center><p>

<b>Part B</b>: To push, you have to do two things, depending on the current size of the
queue.  If it is zero, then simply create a one-element queue whose <b>first</b> and <b>last</b>
pointers point to the only node.  Otherwise, you allocate a new node, and have the last element point to it. In either case, you update the size:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
void Queue::Push(string s)
{
  Qnode *n;

  n = new Qnode;
  n-&gt;s = s;
  n-&gt;ptr = NULL;

  if (size == 0) {
    first = n;
  } else {
    last-&gt;ptr = n;
  }
  last = n;
  size++;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

<b>Part C</b>: The easy way is to do a simple loop using <b>Empty()</b> and <b>Pop</b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
Queue::~Queue()
{
  while (!Empty()) Pop();
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

That only gets you half credit, though, because it is inefficient performance-wise.
Instead, start at the first node and traverse to the back, calling <b>delete</b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
Queue::~Queue()
{
  Qnode *tmp;

  while (first != NULL) {
    tmp = first;
    first = first-&gt;ptr;
    delete tmp;
  }
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

<hr><h2>Question 2: 12 Points</h2>

<b>Part A</b>: 2439016044 mod 50 equals 44.  Therefore, the indices are 44, 45, 46 and 47.
<p>
<b>Part B</b>: With quadratic probing, we add <i>i<sup>2</sup></i> to the index for <i>i</i>
equals 0, 1, 2 and 3.  Therefore, the indices are 44, 45, 48 and 3 (since you have to take the result mod 50).
<p>
<b>Part C</b>: With double hashing, we add <i>i*h</i> to the index for 
<i>i</i> equals 0, 1, 2 and 3, and <i>h</i> equal to the other hash.
The other hash in this case is 230264537, which equls 37 mod 50.  
Therefore, the indices are 44, 81%50 = 31, 118%50 = 18 and 155%50 = 5.
<p>

<b>Part D</b>: We perform the same mechanics as in <b>Part C</b>, only now
the initial index is 2 and <i>h</i> is 32.  
Therefore, the indices are 2, 34, 66%50 = 16 and 98%50 = 48.

<hr><h2>Question 3: 6 Points</h2>

The point of this question was to realize the following:

<UL>
<LI> Lists and deques are roughly equal here -- the erase operation is constant time.
Thus, the while loop takes <i>n</i> operations to complete, and 
the initial size of the list/deque is what matters.
<LI> Vectors have to move <i>n</i> elements when you erase element 0.  Therefore the
loop will take roughly <i>n<sup>2</sup></i> operations when the vector starts with <i>n</i>
elements.   When the vector starts with 1000 elements, the loop will take roughly 1,000,000
operations, which is much slower than the list/deque cases.  The vector with 2500 elements
is even slower.

<UL>
<LI> <b>A</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b> and <b>F</b> in the correct relative order: 3 points
<LI> <b>B</b> and <b>E</b> at the end: 3 points (just 1 if you only had <b>E</b> at the end).

<hr><h2>Question 4: 8 Points</h2>

Since you don't want to strip duplicate lines, you should use a <b>multiset</b>:

<b><a href="setsort.cpp">setsort.cpp</a></b>

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
#include &lt;set&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

main()
{
  multiset &lt;string&gt; l;
  multiset &lt;string&gt;::iterator lit;
  string s;

  while (getline(cin, s)) l.insert(s);
  
  for (lit = l.begin(); lit != l.end(); lit++) cout &lt;&lt; *lit &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

<h3>Grading</h3>

<hr><h2>Question 5: 10 Points</h2>

<b>Command A:</b>  This sets <b>mod</b> equal to 3.  We then have 29%3=2, 45%3=0,
10%3=1, 6%3=0 and 60%3=0.  Thus, the map holds the following [key,value] pairs: [0,3], [1,1]
and [2,1].  The program prints:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
0: 3 -> 1
1: 1 -> 1
2: 1 -> 3
</pre></td></table></center><p>


<b>Command B:</b>  This sets <b>mod</b> equal to 7.  We then have 6%7=6,
5%7=5, 13%7=6, 20%7=6 and 27%7=6.
Thus, the map holds the following [key,value] pairs: [5,1], [6,6].
The program prints:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
5: 1 -> 4
6: 4 -> 0
</pre></td></table></center><p>


<b>Command C:</b>  This sets <b>mod</b> equal to 5.  We then have 100%5=0,
54%5=4, and 15%5=0.
Thus, the map holds the following [key,value] pairs: [0,2], [4,1].  However, 
when <i>i</i> equals zero in the loop, looking up <b>m[1]</b> to print it out actually
inserts it into the map with a value of zero.  Therefore, all values of <i>i</i>
are printed, between 0 and 4:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
0: 2 -> 0
1: 0 -> 0
2: 0 -> 0
3: 0 -> 1
4: 1 -> 2
</pre></td></table></center><p>

<hr><h2>Question 6: 5 Points</h2>

First, if they just had <b>Users</b> in their second field, they would use twice as
much memory, because the users would have to be duplicated.
<p>
Second, if they just had <b>Users</b> in their second field, then the users
in <b>Names</b> would have to be duplicates of those in <b>Phones</b>.  Were you 
to perform an action such as <b>Add_Phone()</b> or <b>Remove_Phone()</b>, it would 
have to act on both the copy in <b>Names</b> and the copy in <b>Phones</b> (and any
other copy that you would have.  By storing a pointer, 
<b>Add_Phone()</b> and <b>Remove_Phone()</b> add or remove a phone from one <b>User</b>,
which is pointed to by <b>Names</b> and <b>Phones</b>.

<LI> Too much memory: 2 points
<LI> Can't share data: 3 points

<hr><h2>Question 7: 8 Points</h2>

You want to keep a count of the number of each kind of digit that you need, and then
you return the maximum count.  The problem is that 6 and 9 complicate matters.  First,
you should use one counter for both.  Then, you should account for the fact that two
of those digits come in each set.  The example, if you have <i>i</i> sixes/nines, then
you need <i>(i+1)/2</i> sets.  
<p>
The program works as follows -- keep a vector <b>count</b>
for the digits, where <b>count[i]</b> is the number of times digit <b>i</b> appears
in the number.  If <b>i</b> is nine, you add it to <b>count[6]</b>.  
<p>
When you're done, set <b>count[6]</b> to <b>(count[6]+1)/2</b>.  Then find the maximum
value in <b>count</b> -- that is the number of sets.
<p>
Here's the code.  I've bundled it up into a program that takes the number on the command
line in
<b><a href="q7.cpp">q7.cpp</a></b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
int RoomNumber::numberOfSets(int n)
{
  vector &lt;int&gt; count;
  int i;
  int digit;
  int max;

  count.resize(9, 0);

  while (n &gt; 0) {
    digit = n % 10;
    n /= 10;
    if (digit == 9) digit = 6;
    count[digit]++;
  }

  count[6] = (count[6]+1)/2;
  max = 0;
  for (i = 0; i &lt; 9; i++) if (count[i] &gt; max) max = count[i];
  return max;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>
