<h2>Comments</h2>

All in all, this was a reasonable exam, and the majority of the class
passed strongly.  I like that.  Question one was a pointer/string function
lecture that you should have been expecting.  Question two was code-writing,
which again you should have been expecting since I said I'd probably put
it on the exam.  Question three required you to write coherently, and
question four was a code-reading exercise.  
<p>
The ranges of grades are below.  If you are in the B and above group,
you're doing fine, although if you received a B or B+, you do need to 
strengthen some areas of your understanding.  
If you are in the C cluster, you really need to spend
some extra time coding.  Clearly the in-class labs and homeworks are not
giving you what you need, and my guess is that you're not getting 100's
on the homeworks -- my advice is to spend the extra time to do so -- you
need to have C code flowing from your fingertips!
<p>
If you are below the C range, you are in trouble, and my advice is to drop
the course, spend some time practicing your coding, and retake the class.
I know no one wants to do so, since it costs you time and either you or
your parents money.  However, this is fundamental material, and you need
to <i>understand it thoroughly</i> and not vaguely.

This is a Tukey Plot, which has lines to the max and min, yellow box denoting
the 1st and 3rd quartiles, hash marks at the median, and dot at the mean.
