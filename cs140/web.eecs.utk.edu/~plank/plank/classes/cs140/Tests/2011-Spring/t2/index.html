<h2>Comments</h2>

This exam was pretty much just right.  It was certainly more
challenging than the midterm.  
<p>
The ranges of grades are below.   I am not breaking up grades into "B+" or "A-".
Instead, I simply break them up into ABCD, and use those scores to calculate your
final scores.  When I get the final scores, I will break up the B's into A-/B+/B,
and the C's into B-/C+/C.
<p>
<UL>
<LI> A+: 42 to 46
<LI> A: 38 to 42
<LI> B: 30 to 38
<LI> C: 25 to 30
<LI> D: 20 to 24
<LI> F: Below 20

This is a Tukey Plot, which has lines to the max and min, yellow box denoting
the 1st and 3rd quartiles, hash marks at the median, and dot at the mean.
<p>
In the <a href="answers.html">"answers and grading"</a>, there are histograms of scores for each question.
