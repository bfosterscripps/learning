Go ahead and think about the problem, and if you think you can solve it, go ahead.  
Otherwise, here is some help.  If a rabbit answers <i>x</i>, then there are <i>x+1</i> rabbits 
that have the same color, including the rabbit who answered.  
<p>
So, the first step (at least for me) is to run through <i>replies</i> and add one to each value.
Now, suppose that there are <i>y</i> entries in <i>replies</i> that equal <i>x</i>.  If <i>y</i> 
is less than or equal to <i>x</i>, then 
all of those rabbits can have the same color: 
There is a minimum of <i>x</i> rabbits with that color. 
<p>
Suppose that <i>y</i> is between <i>x+1</i> and <i>2x</i>.  Then there must be two colors among those rabbits, so the number of rabbits is <i>2x</i>.  
<p>
Suppose that <i>y</i> is between <i>2x+1</i> and <i>3x</i>.  Then there must be three colors among those rabbits, so the number of rabbits is <i>3x</i>.  And so on.
<p>
So what you need to do to solve this problem is to count the number of entries of <i>replies</i> that have each possible value of <i>replies</i>.  Then for each of those values, you calculate the minimum number of rabbits.  That sum is the minimum number of rabbits.
<hr>
Let's use example 1.  The first thing that we do is increment each element of <i>replies</i> so
that it equals { 2, 2, 3, 3 }.  Now we count the number of entries that has each value:
<p>
<UL>
<LI> There are two entries equal to 2.  In other words, <i>y</i> equals 2 and <i>x</i> equals 2.
The minimum number of rabbits here is 2.
<LI> There are two entries equal to 3.  In other words, <i>y</i> equals 2 and <i>x</i> equals 3.
The minimum number of rabbits here is 3.
<LI> So the total number of rabbits is 5.
</UL>

Let's take example 2.  We first increment each element of <i>replies</i> so
that it equals { 3, 3, 45, 3, 3, 3, 445, 3, 3 }.  Now we count the number of entries that has each value:
<p>
<UL>
<LI> There are seven entries equal to 3.  In other words, <i>y</i> equals 7 and <i>x</i> equals 3.
There must be three different colors, so the minimum number of rabbits is 9.  Put another way,
<i>y</i> is between <i>2x+1</i> and <i>3x</i>, so the minimum is <i>3x</i>.
<LI> There is one entry equal to 45.  In other words, <i>y</i> equals 1 and <i>x</i> equals 45.
The minimum number of rabbits here is <i>x = 45</i>.
<LI> There is one entry equal to 445.  In other words, <i>y</i> equals 1 and <i>x</i> equals 445.
The minimum number of rabbits here is <i>x = 445</i>
<LI> So the total number of rabbits is 9 + 45 + 445 = 499.
</UL>

To perform the counting (determining the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>), I want you to use
a map.  The keys will be <i>x</i> and the vals will be <i>y</i>.  After you initialize the
map, you simply run through it figuring out the minimum number of rabbits for each value of
<i>x</i>.
<p>
There are, of course, other ways to do this.  You can sort <i>replies</i> and then do the 
counting from that.  I don't want you do to that, because it's more bug-prone than using
a map (and I want you to get practice using the map).
You can also insert each value of <i>x</i> into a multiset and use the multiset's <i>count()</i>
method.  I think
that's bug-prone too, and it's inefficient because the multiset is much larger than the map
(think about inserting 100 of the same values).
