Exercise 1.9. 
===
Each of the following two procedures defines a method for adding two positive integers in terms of the procedures inc, which increments its argument by 1, and dec, which decrements its argument by 1.

`(define (+ a b) (if (= a 0) b (inc (+ (dec a) b))))`

`(define (+ a b) (if (= a 0) b (+ (dec a) (inc b))))`

Using the substitution model, illustrate the process generated by each procedure in evaluating `(+ 4 5)`.

Are these processes iterative or recursive?


The first procedure is a recursive process - it requires a chain of deferred operations that grows the process until the condition is met.
`(+ 4 5)` would look like:
1. 4 doesn't equal 0, so `(inc (+ (dec 4) 5)))`
2. the `(+ (dec 4) 5)` would evaluate to `(+ 3 5)` - which would repeat the above process until you reach `(+ 0 5)` - which then would end the expansion (because the final recursion returns b instead of calling itself) and begin the return to the main function.
3. as it returns to the main function, each deferred operation is going to add 1 to the 5, so you will have 4 iterations of `(inc 5)` before finally returning 9 as output from the main procedure.


The second procedure doesn't require deferred action and strikes me as an iterative process because it keeps track of the state of the process without expansion.
`(+ 4 5)` would look like:
1. 4 doesn't equal 0, so `(+ (dec 4) (inc b))` is called - which turns out to be `(+ 3 6)`
2. this decrementing the first parameter and incrementing the second parameter continues as an iterative process (though with procedural recursion)
3. finally you reach `(+ 0 9)` which returns 9 - but not as a deferred operation of a main procedure, but as a standalone procedure which just happened to continued to be called by itself.

Just checked my answer - looks like I was right.
