<h3>Scores</h3>

This is by far the <i>shortest</i> exam I've ever given.  Of the 61 who finished
the exam, only two stayed until the end.  To that end, I was expecting really high scores,
and I ended up getting pretty much what I always get.  I'm undecided as to whether that
is disappointing to me.
<p>
To future students who are using this exam as a study guide, I give you the following
advice.  If you're done 30 minutes early, go over your exam again and make sure that
you are answering the question that I asked.  For example, those of you who used vectors for 
Question 1 probably should have reread the question, especially the comment about <i>O(n)</i>
space.  Those of you who only addressed case 3 in question 4 should have remembered 
that there were three cases upon proofreading.
<p>
Yes, question 3 was hard, but I assume that you reread the lecture notes as part of
studying, and that if you didn't understand the recursion in class, you made sure that
you did as part of studying.
