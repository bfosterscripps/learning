<h3>Question 6</h3>

You are writing a program that digests input files like <b>inputfile</b>.  
The program's name is <b>digest.c</b>, and it reads its input from standard
input.  The
format of an input file is that each line contains a name (any number of words,
no word may be a number), then a number <i>n</i> of scores, and then <i>n</i> scores.
Note, <b>inputfile</b> adheres to this format.  For example, Tiger Woods's line has
four scores: 72, 64, 70, 71.  Scores are floating point numbers.
<p>
There may be comment lines which begin with '#' as the first character on the
line -- these should be ignored.
<p>
You are to write a program that reads in a file of this format, and prints out
for each line:
<p>
<UL>
<LI> The average of all scores on the line, with 4 decimal places and 10 overall
characters (e.g. use <b>"%10.4lf"</b> to print out the average).
<LI> The name.
</ul>
<p>

Therefore running <b>digest < inputfile</b> will yield:
<pre>
   69.2500 Tiger Woods
   68.3333 Vijay Singh
   72.2000 Phil Mickelson
   73.5000 Davis Love III
   70.3333 Sergio Garcia
   69.0000 Cher
   99.0000 E. Power Biggs
</pre>

<p>
You may assume that the input file is in the correct format -- in other
words, you do not need to do <i>any</i> error checking!!!!
