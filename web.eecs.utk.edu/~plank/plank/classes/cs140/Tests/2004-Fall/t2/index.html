I have to admit, given the fact that <i>everyone</i> left early, I 
was a bit disappointed that the performance of the class as a whole
was not better, especially on the two coding questions, where you 
could have taken as much time as you needed to make sure that the
details were correct.  Regardless, if you are interested, please 
read the answers.
