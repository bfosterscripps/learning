AVL Trees are binary search trees that are <i>balanced</i>.  This is a 
very nice property because it guarantees that finds, insertions and
deletions are all executed in logarithmic time.
That means that if there are <i>n</i> items in the tree, the operations
take roughly <i>log<sub>2</sub>n</i> time.  That's as good as you can do,
by the way.

To help motivate the need for balancing, think about what happens if you
insert into a regular binary search tree, and the input is already 
sorted.  The tree becomes a gigantic line, and if the size of the tree
is <i>n</i> elements, then performing each insertion
takes <i>n</i> operations.  Performing all <i>n</i> insertions takes
roughly <i>n<sup>2</sup></i> operations.  For example (do this 
in the binary search tree directory):

</pre>

That's a big problem with binary search trees.  AVL trees (and other balanced
trees like Splay trees, Red-Black trees, B-trees, 2-3 trees, etc) make sure
that their trees are balanced so that the various operations are much faster.
For example, the program <b>avltree_test</b> is my solution to the AVL Tree
lab (which some semesters will not have the pleasure of implementing):

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>time avltree_test - < input.txt</b></font>
0.099u 0.003s 0:00.10 90.0%	0+0k 0+0io 0pf+0w

0.336u 0.011s 0:00.34 100.0%	0+0k 0+0io 0pf+0w
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>time sh -c "sort input.txt > /dev/null"</b></font>
0.245u 0.007s 0:00.25 96.0%	0+0k 0+0io 0pf+0w
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

As you can see, since sorting takes .25 seconds, performing insertions with 
the AVL tree takes the same time when the input is sorted as when it is not
sorted.

<h3>Rotations</h3>
<p>
A central operation with AVL Trees is a <i>rotation</i>.  It is a way of 
changing a binary search tree so that it remains a binary search tree,
but changes how it is balanced.  The concept is illustrated below:

<p><center><table border=0><td><img src="Balance.jpg" width=450></td></table></center><p>

<b>B</b> and <b>D</b> are nodes in a binary search tree.  They can occur anywhere
a tree, but we don't worry about what's above them -- just what's below them.
<b>A</b>, <b>C</b> and <b>E</b> are subtrees that rooted as the children of
<b>B</b> and <b>D</b>.  They may be empty.  If they are not empty, then since
the tree is a binary search tree, we know that:
<p>
<UL>
<LI> Every node in <b>A</b> has a key less than <b>B</b>'s key.
<LI> Every node in <b>C</b> has a key less than <b>D</b>'s key, but greater than <b>B</b>'s key.
<LI> Every node in <b>E</b> has a key greater than <b>D</b>'s key.
</UL>
<p>
When we perform a rotation, we perform it <i>about</i> a node.  For example,
the rotation pictured above rotates about node <b>D</b> to turn the tree on the
left to the tree on the right.  It also shows that you can turn the tree on the
right to the tree on the left by rotating about node <b>B</b>.
<p>
When you rotate about a node, you are going to change the tree so that the
node's parent is now the node's child.  The middle subtree (subtree <b>C</b>) 
will change from being one node's child to being the other node's child.
The rotation does not violate any of the properties of binary search trees.
However, it changes the shape of the tree, and there are multiple types
of trees, like AVL, Splay  and Red-Black trees that 
employ rotations to ensure that the trees are balanced.
<p>
Below are some example rotations. Make sure you understand all of them:

<p><center><table border=3><tr><td><img src="B1.jpg" width=450></td></tr>
                           <tr><td><img src="B2.jpg" width=500></td></tr>
                           <tr><td><img src="B3.jpg" width=500></td></tr>
                           <tr><td><img src="B4.jpg" width=500></td></tr></table></center><p>

<h3>AVL Trees</h3>

An AVL Tree is a binary search tree that has conditions on the <i>height</i> of each 
node.  The height is defined to be the length of the longest path from that node
to a leaf node.  Thus, in the left tree in the last diagram, <i>Eunice's</i>
height is three and <i>Binky's</i> height is two.  In the right tree, 
<i>Eunice's</i> 
height is still three, but <i>Binky's</i> height is now one.  Leaf nodes have
a height of zero.  Since each node roots a subtree, we say that the height of 
a subtree is the height of its root. An empty tree has a height of -1.
<p>
The definition of an AVL tree is follows:
<p>
<UL> 
<LI> Every subtree of the tree is an AVL tree.
<LI> For each node, the difference between the heights of its left and right subtrees is 
at most one.
</UL>
Below are some AVL trees:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src="AVL-1.jpg" width=40 valign=center align=center></td>
<td><img src="AVL-2.jpg" width=80 valign=center align=center></td>
<td><img src="AVL-3.jpg" width=120 valign=center align=center></td>
<td><img src="AVL-4.jpg" width=160 valign=center align=center></td>
<td><img src="AVL-5.jpg" width=180 valign=center align=center></td></table></center><p>

And below are two trees that are binary search trees, but are not AVL
trees.
<p><center><table border=3><td valign=bottom align=center><img src="Non-AVL-1.jpg" width=80>
<br><i>Binky</i> violates the definition</td>
<td valign=bottom align=center><img src="Non-AVL-2.jpg" width=180>
<br><i>Fred</i> violates the definition</td></table></center><p>

<hr>
<h3>Insertion into AVL Trees</h3>

To implement AVL trees, you need to maintain the height of each node.
You insert into an AVL tree by performing a standard binary tree insertion.  
When you're done, you check each node on the path from the new node to
the root.  The checking goes as follows:

<UL>
<LI> If that node's height hasn't changed because of the insertion,
then you are done.  You may stop checking, and the insertion is complete.
<LI> If the node's height has changed, but it does not
violate the balance property, then you continue checking the next node
in the path up to the root.
<LI>  If the node's height has changed and it now violates the
balance property, then you need to perform one or two rotations to 
fix the problem, and then you are done.
</UL>
<p>
Let's try some examples.  Suppose I have the following AVL tree -- I now annotate
the nodes with their heights:

<p><center><table border=0><td><img src="AVL-6.jpg" width=200></td></table></center><p>

If I insert <i>Ahmad</i>, take a look at the resulting tree:

<p><center><table border=0><td><img src="AVL-7.jpg" width=200></td></table></center><p>

The new node <i>Ahmad</i> has a height of zero, and when I travel the path up to
the root, I change <i>Baby Daisy's</i> height to one.  However, her node is not
imbalanced, since the height of her subtrees are 0 and -1.  Moving on, <i>Binky's</i>
height is unchanged, so we can stop -- the resulting tree is indeed an AVL tree.
<p>
However, suppose I now try to insert <i>Waluigi</i>.  I get the following
tree:

<p><center><table border=0><td><img src="AVL-8.jpg" width=240></td></table></center><p>

Traveling from the new node to the root, I see that <i>Fred</i> violates the balance
condition.  Its left child has a height of -1 and its right child has a height of 1.
I have to <i>rebalance</i> the tree.

<hr>
<h3>Rebalancing: Zig-Zig</h3>

Now, suppose I insert a node into a tree, and I discover that it is imbalanced
at a node.  There are two ways that this can happen, and they are called
(for reasons that will become obvious later) 
<i>zig-zig</i> and <i>zig-zag</i>.  
We'll start with the Zig-Zig case.  This happens when you have a tree of the following
general form:

<p><center><table border=0 cellpadding=10>
<td><img src="AVL-ZZ-Ex1A.jpg" width=200></td>
<td align=center valign=center width=200> And you insert a node into tree <b>F</b>, which changes
<b>F</b>'s height from <i>h-3</i> to <i>h-2</i>.  Let's assume that <b>F</b>
is still an AVL tree, so we have this tree, where 
<b>A</b>
<b>C</b> and
<b>F</b> are all AVL trees:</td>
<td><img src="AVL-ZZ-Ex1B.jpg" width=200></td>
</table></center><p>

You'll note that the tree is imbalanced, and it is imbalanced at node <b>B</b>.  Let's 
give some concrete examples:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=10>
<tr><td><img src="AVL-ZZ-Ex2A.jpg" width=120></td>
<td align=center valign=center width=200> You insert <b>F</b> into the tree:
<p>
Make sure you can match this example up with its general form above.
In this case, <i>h=2</i>, both before and after.</td>
<td><img src="AVL-ZZ-Ex2B.jpg" width=180></td></tr>
<tr><td><img src="AVL-ZZ-Ex4A.jpg" width=300></td>
<td align=center valign=center width=200> You insert "Jasper" into the tree:
<p>
Make sure you can match this example up with its general form above.
In this case, <i>h=4</i>, both before and after.</td>
<td><img src="AVL-ZZ-Ex4B.jpg" width=300></td><tr>
<tr><td><img src="AVL-ZZ-Ex3A.jpg" width=250></td>
<td align=center valign=center width=200> 
You insert an element into either <b>E</b> or <b>G</b>, changing its height,
but not violating the AVL property:
<p>
Make sure you can match this example up with its general form above.
<td><img src="AVL-ZZ-Ex3B.jpg" width=250></td><tr>
</table></center><p>

Let's take that last example as the general form of a Zig-Zig insertion:

<p><center><table border=0><td><img src="Zig-Zig-1.jpg" width=400></td></table></center><p>

In this case, the path from the imbalanced node (<b>B</b>) to the newly added node
starts with two right children.  That's what makes it "Zig-Zig".
To rebalance the tree, you perform a rotation about
node <b>D</b>:

<p><center><table border=0><td><img src="Zig-Zig-2.jpg" width=250></td></table></center><p>

Node <b>D</b> is the new root of the subtree.  Before the insertion, node <b>B</b>'s
height was <i>h-1</i>, so the height of the subtree has not changed because of the
rotation.  Thus, after performing the rotation, you may return from your insertion:
you are left with a valid AVL tree.
<p>
If the path from the imbalanced node to the newly added node starts with two
left children, then you have another Zig-Zig case (the mirror image).  You treat it in the same way:
rotate about the imbalanced node's left child.
<p>
Before going on, take a look at our example above where we inserted <i>Jasper</i>, which led
to the tree being imbalanced around <i>Daisy</i>.  We can identify this as a 
Zig-Zig case, so we can fix it by rotating about <i>Garth</i>:

<p><center><table border=3>
<td align=center valign=top><u>Before</u><br><img src="AVL-ZZ-Ex4B.jpg" width=300></td>
<td align=center valign=top><u>After</u><br><img src="AVL-ZZ-Ex4C.jpg" width=350></td>
</table></center><p>

Here's another example, where we inserted <i>Waluigi</i> and that made the tree imbalanced
at <i>Fred</i>:

<p><center><table border=3>
<td align=center valign=top><u>Before</u><br><img src="Zig-Zig-3.jpg" width=350></td>
<td align=center valign=top><u>After</u><br><img src="Zig-Zig-4.jpg" width=266></td>
</table></center><p>


<hr>
<h3>Rebalancing: Zig-Zag</h3>

The other rebalancing case is the Zig-Zag case, pictured below.  I'm starting with the
general form, so try to invision an example of how this happens:

<p><center><table border=0><td><img src="Zig-Zag-1.jpg" width=320></td></table></center><p>

To fix this, you perform two rotations.  You rotate about node <b>D</b>, and then
you rotate about node <b>D</b> again.  This is called a <i>double rotation</i> about
node <b>D</b>.  Here are the two rotations:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src="Zig-Zag-2.jpg" width=220>
                           <td><img src="Zig-Zag-3.jpg" width=237></td></table></center><p>

Once again, the height of the subtree before deletion was <i>h-1</i>, so when you're
done with the double rotation, you are done -- your tree is balanced.  Again, the
mirror image case is treated in the exact same manner.
<p>
Here's an example.  Suppose our tree is the following, rather large tree:

<p><center><table border=0><td><img src="AVL-9.jpg" width=300></td></table></center><p>

And suppose we insert <i>Boo</i> into the tree:

<p><center><table border=0><td><img src="Zig-Zag-4.jpg" width=300></td></table></center><p>

Checking for balancing, we have to increment every height up to the root, and 
the root node <i>Eunice</i> is imbalanced.  Since the path to the new node starts
with a left child and a right child, this is a Zig-Zag case, and we need to perform
a double rotation about the grandchild of the imbalanced node -- <i>Daisy</i>.  
Below is the result.  We have a nicely balanced AVL tree!

<p><center><table border=0><td><img src="Zig-Zag-5.jpg" width=400></td></table></center><p>

<hr>
<h3>Deletion</h3>

When you delete a node, there are three things that can happen to the parent:
<p>
<UL>
<LI> Its height is decremented by one.  
An example of this is if <i>Boo</i> is deleted from the above tree -- <i>Calista</i>'s
height is decremented by one.
<LI> Its height doesn't change and it stays balanced.
An example of this is if <i>Fred</i> is deleted -- <i>Luther's</i> 
height is unchanged and it is balanced.
<LI> Its height doesn't change, but it becomes imbalanced.
An example of this is if <i>Dontonio</i> is deleted -- <i>Eunice's</i> 
height is unchanged, but she is imbalanced.
</UL>

You handle these three cases in different ways:

<UL>
<LI> The parent's height is decremented by one.  When this happens, the 
parent will always still be a valid AVL tree.  However, you need to now
check the parent's parent: you keep doing this until you return or you
reach the root of the tree.
<LI> The parent's height doesn't change and it stays balanced.
When this happens you may return -- deletion is over.
<LI> The parent's height doesn't change, but it becomes imbalanced.
When this happens, you have to rebalance the subtree rooted at the
parent.  After rebalancing, the subtree's height may be one smaller
than it was originally. If so, you must continue checking the parent's
parent.
</UL>


To rebalance, you need to identify whether you are in a zig-zig situation or
a zig-zag situation and rebalance accordingly.  How do you do this?  Look
at the following picture:

<p><center><table border=3><td align=center><img src="Identify.jpg" width=220 align=center><hr>
Imbalanced Identification Picture</td></table></center><p>

The imbalanced node is <b>B</b>.  If the height of subtree <b>C</b> is <i>h-3</i>, then
the height of <b>E</b> will be <i>h-2</i> and the tree is a Zig-Zig
-- you can rebalance by rotating about node <b>D</b>.  If the
height of subtree <b>E</b> is <i>h-3</i>, then the height of <b>C</b> is <i>h-2</i> and
the tree is a Zig-Zag -- you rebalance
by doing a double rotation about the root of <b>C</b>.  If both <b>C</b> and <b>E</b> have
heights of <i>h-2</i>, then you treat it as either a Zig-Zig or a Zig-Zag.  Both work.
For the purposes of your lab, treat this case like a Zig-Zig.
<p>
The mirror image works the same way.  
<p>
Let's look at some examples.  First, suppose we delete <i>Calista</i> from the
following tree:

<p><center><table border=0><td><img src="Delete-1.jpg" width=170></td></table></center><p>

You're left with:

<p><center><table border=0><td><img src="Delete-2.jpg" width=140></td></table></center><p>

You check <i>Calista's</i> old parent -- <i>Binky</i> and although <i>Binky's</i> 
height hasn't changed, the node is imbalanced.  It's clearly a Zig-Zig tree, so
you rotate about <i>Baby Daisy</i> to yield the following tree:

<p><center><table border=0><td><img src="Delete-3.jpg" width=140></td></table></center><p>

Since <i>Baby Daisy</i> is the root, we're done.
<p>
Let's try a more complex example -- deleting <i>Eunice</i> from the following
tree:

<p><center><table border=0><td><img src="Delete-4.jpg" width=360></td></table></center><p>

First, <i>Eunice</i> has two children.  So, we find the child with the greatest 
key in <i>Eunice's</i> left subtree, which is <i>Dontonio</i>, delete it, and
replace <i>Eunice</i> with <i>Dontonio</i>.  We start by deleting <i>Dontonio</i>:

<p><center><table border=0><td><img src="Delete-5.jpg" width=360></td></table></center><p>

And we start checking at <i>Eunice</i>.  It is imbalanced.  Looking at it, we see that
it's a Zig-Zag, so we have to double-rotate about <i>Fred</i>:

<p><center><table border=0><td><img src="Delete-6.jpg" width=360></td></table></center><p>

Now, the subtree rooted by <i>Fred</i> is balanced, but the subtree's height is one
less than it used to be, so we need to move to its parent and check it.  Its
height is unchanged, and it is balanced, so we're done -- as a last step, we
replace <i>Eunice</i> with <i>Dontonio</i>:  

<p><center><table border=0><td><img src="Delete-7.jpg" width=360></td></table></center><p>

<hr>
Here's a larger example.  We're going to delete <i>Daisy</i> from the following
AVL tree:

<p><center><table border=0><td><img src="Delete-8.jpg" width=420></td></table></center><p>

As in the previous example, <i>Daisy</i> has two children, so we find the node with
the largest key in <i>Daisy's</i> left subtree: <i>Calista</i>.  We are going to 
delete <i>Calista</i> and then replace <i>Daisy</i> with <i>Calista</i>.  So, we
first delete <i>Calista</i>:

<p><center><table border=0><td><img src="Delete-9.jpg" width=420></td></table></center><p>

We start our checking with <i>Calista's</i> old parent: <i>Binky</i>.  The node is
imbalanced, so we have to determine whether it is Zig-Zig or Zig-Zag.  I'll redraw it
so it fits the Imbalanced Identification Picture:

<p><center><table border=0><td><img src="Delete-A.jpg" width=420></td></table></center><p>

In this example, <i>h</i> is three, and we're looking at the mirror image of the 
Imbalanced Identification Picture.  
You can see from the picture that the tree
is Zig-Zig, so we do a single rotation about <i>Baby Daisy</i>:

<p><center><table border=0><td><img src="Delete-B.jpg" width=440></td></table></center><p>

Since the tree rooted at <i>Baby Daisy</i> has a smaller height, we need to check
its parent (<i>Daisy</i>).  <i>Daisy's</i> height is too high, so it needs to be
decremented, and since it's the root of the tree, we're done.  We replace <i>Daisy</i>
with <i>Calista</i>, and return.

<p><center><table border=0><td><img src="Delete-C.jpg" width=440></td></table></center><p>

<hr>
One final example.  Let's delete <i>Frenchy</i> from the following tree:

<p><center><table border=0><td><img src="Delete-D.jpg" width=440></td></table></center><p>

We're left with the following tree, and when we start checking <i>Frenchy's</i> old
parent, <i>Galois</i>, it is imbalanced:

<p><center><table border=0><td><img src="Delete-E.jpg" width=440></td></table></center><p>

I've drawn the subtrees for the Imbalanced Identification picture.  <i>h</i> is two, and the
<b>C</b> and <b>E</b> subtrees are both of height <i>h-2</i>.  Thus, we can treat it
either as a Zig-Zig or a Zig-Zag.  We will treat it as a Zig-Zig (which you should do 
in your lab) and do a single rotation about <i>Xavier</i>.


<p><center><table border=0><td><img src="Delete-F.jpg" width=440></td></table></center><p>

Since the subtree's height is the same as it was before, we can return.

<hr>
<h3>Practice</h3>

What is the tree that results when you delete <i>Xerxes</i> from the above tree?  I'm not going to work through this in 
steps for you.  Convince yourself that it will be the following tree:

<p><center><table border=0><td><img src="Delete-G.jpg" width=440></td></table></center><p>

To get that, you had to do a Zig-Zag balancing, and a Zig-Zig balancing.
