<hr>

The simplest way to do this is to remove the z's from <i>goal</i> and seeing if the
result equals <i>init.</i>  How best to remove the z's from <i>goal</i>?  Create 
a new string <i>s</i> by traversing <i>goal</i>, and calling <b>push_back()</b> on 
each non-z character in <i>goal</i>.  My solution was three lines of code.
