<h2>Answer to Question 1</h2>

<UL>
<LI> <b>Part 1:</b>  Look at the implementation of <b>dll_append</b>.
This is a <b>malloc()</b> and a few pointer operations.  Answer: <i>a</i>.
<LI> <b>Part 2:</b>  In the worst case, the splay tree is a line, as in
Question 4, and the operation has to go over every element.  Splay trees
guarantee good behavior over collections of operations, not over
single operations.  Answer: <i>c</i>.
<LI> <b>Part 3:</b>  AVL trees guarantee that insertion and find
operations are in log time: 
Answer: <i>b</i>.
<LI> <b>Part 4:</b>  In the worst case, all <i>n</i> elements are 
consecutively located, and you try to find an element that requires you
to search all <i>n</i> elements.
Answer: <i>c</i>.
<LI> <b>Part 5:</b>  All tree traversals visit each node and link
once.  There are <i>n</i> nodes and <i>n-1</i> links.  Answer: <i>c</i>.
<LI> <b>Part 6:</b>  This performs a constant number of pointer operations:
Answer: <i>a</i>.
<LI> <b>Part 7:</b>  Here is where the performance of splay trees is
good -- the operations average to be logarithmic: 
Answer: <i>d</i>.
<LI> <b>Part 8:</b>  Straightforward:
Answer: <i>d</i>.
<LI> <b>Part 9:</b>  This creates a line, and is the worst-case for binary
trees: Answer: <i>e</i>.
<LI> <b>Part 10:</b>  Again straightforward: Answer: <i>d</i>.

<h2>Answer to Question 2</h2>

<h3>Part 1</h3>
63 mod 32 equals 31.  Since elements 31, and 0 through 3 are taken, 
the element will go into location 4.

<h3>Part 2</h3>

With quadratic probing, we test <i>h</i>, which equals 31.  It is taken, 
so we test <i>(h+1*1)%32</i>, which equals 0.  That is taken, so we test
<i>(h+2*2)%32</i>, which equals 3.  That is taken, so we test
<i>(h+3*3)%32</i>, which equals 8.  That is also taken, so we test
<i>(h+4*4)%32</i>, which equals 15.  That one is free, so that is where 
it goes.  Answer = 15.

<hr>
<h2>Answer to Question 3</h2>

There exist positive constants <i>n</i> and <i>m</i> such that for
all values of <i>r</i> greater than <i>n</i>, <i>m*b(r) > a(r)</i>.
That is answer <i>e</i>.  The only other answer that makes any sense
is <i>n</i>, although it does not define what <i>r_0</i> is.  If <i>r_0</i>
is a positive constant, and <i>n</i> equals 1 (which of course is a 
positive constant), then you'll note that answer <i>n</i> is equivalent
to answer <i>e</i>.  None of the other answers are even close.

<h2>Answer to Question 5</h2>

<h3>Part 1</h3>

The internal nodes hold the minimum keys of all but their
leftmost subtrees.  So:

<center><IMG src="B-Tree-1-A1.jpg"></center><p>

<h3>Part 2</h3>

When 15 is added, the external node holding it has five values, so the node
must be split into two nodes, one with three values, and one with two.
This adds an extra link to its parent, which now has five links, so it too
must be split.  If we split the left sides of each node into two, and the
right sides into three, then the resulting tree is:
<center><IMG src="B-Tree-1-A2a.jpg"></center><p>
If we split the left sides of each node into three, and the
right sides into two, then the resulting tree is:
<center><IMG src="B-Tree-1-A2b.jpg"></center><p>
These are the only two correct answers.  An optimization of B-trees would
"borrow" a slot from a neighboring node, such as:
<center><IMG src="B-Tree-1-A2c.jpg"></center><p>
However, this answer did not receive full credit, since it is not part
of the standard definition of B-Trees.

<h2>Answer to Question 6</h2>

This is a very simple recursival postorder traversal.    If my left subtree
is a binary search tree whose maximum key is less than mine, and my 
right subtree is a binary search tree whose minimum key is greater than
mine, then this is a binary search tree:

<p>
<center>
<table border=3 cellpadding=3><td>
<pre>int is_bstree(BTreeNode *root, double *min, double *max)
{
  double subtree_min, subtree_max;

  if (root->left == NULL) {
    *min = root->key.d;
  } else {
    if (!is_bstree(root->left, &subtree_min, &subtree_max)) return 0;
    if (subtree_max >= root->key.d) return 0;
    *min = subtree_min;
  }

  if (root->right == NULL) {
    *max = root->key.d;
  } else {
    if (!is_bstree(root->right, &subtree_min, &subtree_max)) return 0;
    if (subtree_min <= root->key.d) return 0;
    *max = subtree_max;
  }

  return 1;
}
</pre></td></table></center>

<h2>Answer to Question 7</h2>

Here is what the tree looks like after reading in the input data:

<p>
<center>
<table border=5 cellpadding=10>
<td>
<IMG src="Rb-tree.jpg">
</td></table>
</center>
<p>
So, it will print out:
<p>
<UL>
<LI> Character 4 of "Gonna": "a"
<LI> Character 0 of "Hey": "H"
<LI> Character 1 of "Joe,": "o"
<LI> Character 7%4=3 of "Now?": "?"
<LI> Character 5%3=2 of "Run": "n"
<LI> Character 6%2=0 of "To": "T"
<LI> Character 2 of "Where": "e"
<LI> Character 3%3=0 of "You": "Y"
</UL>
Meaning the answer is: <b>aHo?nTeY</b>
<p>
You can cut/paste the program and try it yourself if you want.
