This is a writeup for the first month of CS140.
<hr>
There are two parts to this problem.  
First, you need to write a loop that allows you to compare every pair of words in <b>words</b>.
For example, in Example 2, you will check:
<UL>
<LI> "ababab" and "bababa"
<LI> "ababab" and "aaabbb"
<LI> "bababa" and "aaabbb"
</UL>
Go ahead and make that your first job -- write a nested loop which simply prints out each 
pair of words.  Here's mine on examples 2, 3 and 4.  Yours doesn't have to work in the same
order, but it does need to generate the same pairs.

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td valign=top>
<b> Example 2:</b><pre>
bababa ababab
aaabbb ababab
aaabbb bababa</pre></td>
<td valign=top>
<b> Example 3:</b><pre>
ele eel
lee eel
lee ele
</pre></td>
<td valign=top>
<b> Example 4:</b><pre>
aab aaa
aba aaa
aba aab
abb aaa
abb aab
abb aba
baa aaa
baa aab
baa aba
baa abb
bab aaa
bab aab
bab aba
bab abb
bab baa
bba aaa
bba aab
bba aba
bba abb
bba baa
bba bab
bbb aaa
bbb aab
bbb aba
bbb abb
bbb baa
bbb bab
bbb bba</pre></td></table></center><p>

Now, given a pair of words, like "tokyo" and "kyoto", how do we determine that they are
interesting?  One simple way is to break up the first word into every combination of two
substrings (which we'll call A and B below), 
concatenate the substrings in reverse order, and see if they equal the second word.  For example:

<p><center>
<table border=3 cellpadding=3>
<tr><td align=center>A</td>
    <td align=center>B</td>
    <td align=center>B + A</td>
    <td align=center>Does it equal "kyoto"?</td></tr>
<tr><td align=center>t</td>
    <td align=center>okyo</td>
    <td align=center>okyot</td>
    <td align=center>No</td></tr>
<tr><td align=center>to</td>
    <td align=center>kyo</td>
    <td align=center>kyoto</td>
    <td align=center>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td align=center>tok</td>
    <td align=center>yo</td>
    <td align=center>yotok</td>
    <td align=center>No</td></tr>
<tr><td align=center>toky</td>
    <td align=center>o</td>
    <td align=center>otoky</td>
    <td align=center>No</td></tr>
</table>
</center><p>

To break up strings into substrings, see the <b>substr()</b> method.  I provide
examples in <a href="../Notes/String/index.html">the 
string lecture notes</a>.

<h3>Running Time</h3>

One of the skills of a computer scientist is being able to determine the running time
of his or her program.  In this instance, we ask the question -- if the size of <b>words</b>
is <i>W</i> and the maximum size of a word is <i>S</i>, then how does the performance of
our program scale with <i>W</i> and <i>S</i>.
<p>
In this instance, you are generating all pairs of words of <b>words</b>, and there are
<i>(W(W+1))/2</i> of these.  For each pair of words, you are calculating <i>S-1</i> 
values of A and B, and the work required to compute A+B is roughly <i>S</i>.
Therefore, your program scales with <i>W</i> and <i>S</i> roughly as:
<center>
<p>
<i>W<sup>2</sup>S<sup>2</sup></i>
</center>
<p>
With topcoder, the maximum <i>W</i> is 50, and the maximum <i>S</i> is also 50, so the equation
above gives you 6,250,000.  That's going to be pushing topcoder's time limits, but it is fast
enough.  Later in the semester, when we study maps, you'll be able to see how to make this
program faster.
