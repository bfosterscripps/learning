<hr>

Only 50% of the topcoders got this one right in the SRM.  That's because there are a few tripping
points.  Here's the solution that came most readily to me.
<p>
If you look at the constraints, the potential (X,Y) values in this problem are from -200 to 200 for both
X and Y.  That's 40,000 potential values.  So, make an two dimensional vector of integers, and for
each value of X/Y/R, add one to all of the potential places in the vector that would be legal for
these values.
<p>
At the end, traverse the vector, and every entry whose value is equal to <b>X.size()</b> is a legal 
place for the Candy store.  Count those up and return them.
<p>
Let's look at example 2.  When we start, here's the relevant part of our vector:
<p><center><table border=0><td><img src="Candy1.jpg"></td></table></center><p>
We first process X[0] = 2, Y[0] = 3 and R[0] = 2.  That sets 17 cells equal to one:
<p><center><table border=0><td><img src="Candy2.jpg"></td></table></center><p>
We then process X[1] = 1, Y[1] = -1 and R[1] = 2.  That increment 17 more cells:
<p><center><table border=0><td><img src="Candy3.jpg"></td></table></center><p>
As you can see, four of those cells have values equal to <b>X.size()</b> = 2.  Therefore, the answer
is 4.
<p>
Now, one problem is the fact that X[i] and Y[i] can assume negative values, and that's not allowed
with vectors.  To fix that, go ahead and add 200 to every value of X and Y.  Then, the potential X/Y
values can be between 0 and 400.  
<p>
Second, writing that loop to increment the vector's values requires a little care.  However, I'm 
positive you are up to the challenge.  Hack it up!
