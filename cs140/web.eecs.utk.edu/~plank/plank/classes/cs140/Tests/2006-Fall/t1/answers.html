<h3>Answer to Question 1 (10 points)</h3>

You may see an explanation of this, plus pictures in the 
lecture notes on Queues:

<pre>
Jval queue_dequeue(Queue q) 
{
  Jval retval;
  True_Queue *tq;
  Queue_Node *qn;

  tq = (True_Queue *) q;
  if (tq->size == 0) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Error: Queue_dequeue called on an empty queue\n");
    exit(1);
  }
  qn = tq->front;
  tq->front = qn->front;
  retval = qn->val;
  free(qn);
  tq->size--;
  return retval;
}
</pre>

<h3>Grading for Question 1 (10 points)</h3>

<UL>
<LI> Casting <b>q</b> to a <b>(True_Queue *)</b>: 1 point
<LI> Error-checking on the size: 1 point
<LI> Setting a temporary variable to <b>tq->front</b>: 1 point
<LI> Setting a temporary variable to return: 1 point
<LI> Detaching the front node: 2 points
<LI> Freeing the node: 1 point
<LI> Decrementing the size: 1 point
<LI> Returning the <b>Jval</b>: 1 point
<LI> Getting it all in the correct order: 1 point
</UL>

<h3>Answer to Question 2</h3>

When we start off, <b>s</b> is 0x500120, <b>s2</b> is 0x500130, and
<b>y</b> is 0xbfffed28.  This means that the address of <b>x</b>
is 0xbfffed28.  The value of <b>x</b> is the address of the
first <b>'e'</b> in the string <b>s</b>.  Since <b>s</b> is equal
to <b>"Juice-em!"</b>, that means that <b>x</b> will equal <b>s+4</b>: 
0x500124.  The statement <b>x[1] = '*'</b> will set the character
after the <b>'e'</b> to an asterisk.  Thus, <b>s</b> now equals
<b>"Juice*em!</b>.  So, we can now go over the first eight lines
of the program, after the first one:
<pre>
0x500124
0xbfffed28
0xbfffed28
0x500124
u
e
0x500121
Juice*em! Juice-em! e*em!
</pre>
Now, setting <b>*y</b> to <b>s2+2</b> means that <b>*y</b> is 
equal to 0x500132.  Since <b>y = &x</b>, this means that <b>x</b>
is also equal to 0x500132.  This is the location of the <b>'i'</b>
in <b>"Juice-em!</b>.  So, setting <b>*x</b> to <b>'X'</b> sets
<b>s2</b> to <b>"JuXce-em!</b>.  Thus, the last two lines of the
program are:
<pre>
0x500132
Juice*em! JuXce-em! Xce-em!
</pre>

<h3>Grading for Question 2 (10 points)</h3>

The program has 11 lines of output.  The first is given
for you, and you were to give the remaining ten.  Here's
how those remaining ten lines were graded:
<UL>
<LI> Lines 3 and 5: Half a point each.
<LI> Lines 8 and 10: 1.5 points each: 0.5 per word.  If you got
line 8 wrong, but the first word of line 10 was the same as the
first word in line 8, you received the 0.5 for that word.
<LI> All other lines were 1 point.  If you missed line 3, but lines
2 and 3 equalled each other, you received a point for line 2.
Ditto lines 1 and 4.
</UL>

<h3>Answer to Question 3 (10 points)</h3>

Correctness:
<UL>
<LI> <b>A</b>.  Incorrect, because it ignores zeros.
<LI> <b>B</b>.  Incorrect, because it reads from standard input instead
of the command line.
<LI> <b>C</b>.  Correct.
<LI> <b>D</b>.  This one looks pretty good, but it's not correct,
      because it tries to read into <b>d</b> instead of <b>&d</b>.
      It will likely segfault.
<LI> <b>E</b>.  Correct.
<LI> <b>F</b>.  Incorrect for a few reasons.  First, it calls <b>atoi</b>,
   and then doesn't print out zeros, which will ignore non-numbers, 
   but it will also ignore zeros.   Second, it calls <b>atoi</b> and
   not <b>atof</b>, so all decimals will be zero.
<LI> <b>G</b>.  Incorrect, because <b>d</b> is an integer, so the
      <b>sscanf()</b> will not properly convert the command line
      arguments correctly.  It will exclude the non-numbers, but
      the values that it prints out are undetermined.  Since the <b>sscanf()</b>
      will modify 8 bytes starting at <b>&d</b>, the four bytes after <b>d</b>
      will get corrupted, which could result in undeterministic behavior.
<LI> <b>H</b>.  Incorrect, because it reads from standard input, and not the 
     command line.  
</UL>

<h3>Grading for Question 3 (10 points)</h3>

0.5 points per program for stating correctness correctly.  0.75 points
per program for stating the output correctly.

<h3>Answer to Question 4 (8 points)</h3>

The variable <b>j</b> counts the words.  When <b>j</b> mod three equals 0 or 2,
the word is enqueued on the queue.  When <b>j</b> mod three equals 1 or 2, then
the length of the word is pushed on the stack.  The variable <b>ne</b> is the
sum of the number of elements on the stack and queue.  
<p>
So, the output is:
<pre>
3 5 5 7 4 1 5 6 2 3 4 3
Cutie bomb Met at a salon With baby louis Under her arm
24
</pre>

<h3>Grading for Question 4 (8 points)</h3>

Three points for line 1, three for line 2, two for line 3.
<hr>
<h3>Answer to Question 5</h3>

A simple program:

<pre>
main()
{
  int c, lastc;

  lastc = -1;
  for (c = getchar(); c != EOF; c = getchar()) {
    if (c != lastc) putchar(c);
    lastc = c;
  }
}
</pre>

You could have used the fields library, but it's a little
more of a pain:

<pre>
main()
{
  int c, lastc, i;
  IS is;

  lastc = -1;
  is = new_inputstruct(NULL);
  while (get_line(is) >= 0) {
    for (i = 0; is->text1[i] != '\0'; i++) {
      c = is->text1[i];
      if (c != lastc) putchar(c);
      lastc = c;
    }
  }
}
</pre>

<h3>Grading for Question 5 (8 points)</h3>

<UL>
<LI> Correctly reading from standard input: 2 points
<LI> Omitting characters properly: 2 points
<LI> Printing characters properly: 2 points
<LI> No extraneous mess: 2 points
</UL>
