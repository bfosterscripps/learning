<hr>
This one tripped up many of the Topcoder contestants -- in fact, only 68 percent of the
contenstants got it.  See if you can do better!
<hr>
The constraints of this problem state that <b>numbers</b> only holds numbers between 1 and 100.
Since (<i>a</i> div <i>b</i>) is always going to be less than <i>a</i>, John's paper will only
hold numbers between 1 and 100.  That puts some constraints on input that we can leverage.
In particular, an <i>n<sup>2</sup></i> solution is going to be plenty fast enough, because the
maximum <i>n</i> is 100.
<p>
Here's a solution that comes to mind -- keep two collections of numbers: those that you
have processed (call it <b>P</b> -- it will be a vector), 
and those that you have not processed (call it <b>N</b> -- also a vector).
You can also keep a table <b>T</b>
of numbers on John's paper.  <b>T</b> should be a vector with 101
elements, and <b>T[<i>i</i>]</b> is set to 1 if <i>i</i> is a number on John's paper.  It is set
to zero otherwise.
<p>
Do the following:
<UL>
<LI> Set <b>N</b> to be <b>numbers</b>.
<LI> Set <b>T</b> to be a vector of 101 elements, each of which is zero.
<LI> Now, set <b>T[<i>i</i>]</b> to one for each element <i>i</i> in <b>N</b>
<LI> Set <b>P</b> to be empty.
<LI> Now, for each element <i>n</i> in <b>N</b>, do the following:
<UL>
<LI> For each element <i>p</i> in <b>P</b>, find <i>k = (n div p)</i>, or 
<i>k = (p div n)</i>, whichever is non-zero.
<LI> Check <b>T</b> to see if <i>k</i> is there, and if it is there, ignore <i>k</i>.
<LI> Otherwise, put <i>k</i> into <b>T</b>, and also add <i>k</i> to <b>N</b>.
<LI> When you're done with each element in <b>P</b>, add <i>n</i> to <b>P</b>.
</UL>
<LI> Finally, return the size of <b>P</b>.
</UL>

Let's illustrate this with Example 0, where <b>numbers</b> is { 9, 2 }.  Below is the
initial state of the three vectors (we only show the first 12 elements of <b>T</b>, 
because all of the higher ones will always be zero):

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src="DBZ0.jpg"></td></table></center><p>

Now, run through <b>N</b> with an integer <i>i</i>.  When <i>i = 0</i>, <i>n = 9</i>.
We want to run through <b>P</b>, but <b>P</b> is empty, so we're done with <i>n</i> -- we
add it to <b>P</b>:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src="DBZ1.jpg"></td></table></center><p>

Next, <i>i = 1</i> and <i>n = 2</i>.  We run through <b>P</b> and there is one element: <i>p = 9</i>.  Since <i>p</i> is bigger than <i>n</i>, we set <i>k = (p div n) = 4</i>.  We check to see
if <b>T[4]</b> = 0, which it does, so we set <b>T[4] = 1</b> and add 4 to <b>N</b>:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src="DBZ2.jpg"></td></table></center><p>

At this point, we're done with <b>P</b>, so we add <i>n</i> to <b>P</b>:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src="DBZ3.jpg"></td></table></center><p>

Finally, we continue with <i>i = 2</i> and <i>n = 4</i>.  We run through <b>P</b>: When
<i>p = 9</i>, <i>k = 2</i>, and since <b>T[2]</b> equals 1, we ignore <i>k</i>.  Similarly, when
<i>p = 2</i>, <i>k</i> also equals 2, and since <b>T[2]</b> equals 1, we ignore <i>k</i> again.  
At this point, we're done with <b>P</b>, so we add <i>n</i> to <b>P</b>:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src="DBZ4.jpg"></td></table></center><p>

Now, we're done with <b>N</b>, so we return the size of <b>P</b>, which is three.  As you can
see, when we're done, <b>P</b> and <b>N</b> will be identical, so we could simply return 
the size of <b>N</b>.
<hr>
I want you to think about why <b>T</b> is the way it is, and why it isn't, say, a vector
containing the numbers on the paper.  The reason is speed -- by having <b>T</b> be a vector
of 101 elements, you can look up a number and see whether it is in <b>T</b> in one operation.
That's much faster, than, say, looping through a vector to see if a number is there.
