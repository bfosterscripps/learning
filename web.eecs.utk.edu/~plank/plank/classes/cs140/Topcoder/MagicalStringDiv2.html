<hr>

At 1199 submissions, a 97% success rate, and an average score of 227.77, this has to be one
of the easiest Topcoder problems in history.  I would hope that you get it in under five minutes.
If you want help, keep reading, but I urge you to figure this one out on your own.
<hr>
When do you change a character?
<UL>
<LI> When its index is less than <b>S.size()/2</b>, and it is not a '>'.
<LI> When its index is greater than or equal to <b>S.size()/2</b>, and it is not a '<'.
</UL>
Run through <b>S</b> and add those up.
