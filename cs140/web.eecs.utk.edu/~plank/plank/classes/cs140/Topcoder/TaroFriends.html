<hr>

This is an example of a topcoder problem that is really easy to
program once you figure out what to program.  I'll be honest -- when
I first did it, I thought of a DP solution that I knew would work, so
I hacked it up and got 406 points.  After I submitted it, I realized
that there was a much easier solution.
<p>
Here is the key realization.  First, let's sort <b>coordinates</b>.  
Now, the cats are going to partitioned into two groups: Those that are
jumping to the left, and those that are jumping to the right.
A solution to this problem will be when all of the cats who are jumping the
right will have lower indices than all of the cats who are jumping to the left.
<p>
Think about that.  Suppose cat <i>i</i> is jumping to the right.  And suppose
that <i>j</i> is an index less than <i>i</i>.  The distance between the two
cats is minimized when cat <i>j</i> also jumps to the right.  What this means is
that if cat <i>i</i> is jumping to the right, then all cats with indices less than
<i>i</i> have to be jumping to the right.
<p>
Similarly, suppose cat <i>i</i> is jumping to the left.  It should be clear that
all cats with indices greater than <i>i</i> should also be jumping to the left.
<p>
Given those two facts, it must be the case that for an optimal solution, all cats
with indices less than <i>i</i>, for some <i>i</i> are jumping to the right, and
all cats with indices greater than or equal to <i>i</i> are jumping to the left.
So, one way to solve this problem is to try all values of <i>i</i> from 0 to 
<b>coordinates.size()</b>, and for each of these, simulate the cats jumping.  Return
the minimum difference from the simulation.
<p>
As always, an example helps.  Let's look at example 0.  Here are the four potential 
values of <i>i</i>:
<UL>
<LI> <i>i = 0</i>: LLL: 
<p><center><table border=3><td><img src="TaroFriends-LLL.jpg"></td></table></center><p>
<LI> <i>i = 1</i>: RLL: 
<p><center><table border=3><td><img src="TaroFriends-RLL.jpg"></td></table></center><p>
<LI> <i>i = 2</i>: RRL: 
<p><center><table border=3><td><img src="TaroFriends-RRL.jpg"></td></table></center><p>
<LI> <i>i = 3</i>: RRR: 
<p><center><table border=3><td><img src="TaroFriends-RRR.jpg"></td></table></center><p>
</UL>
The best is three.  
<p>
Now, given a value of <i>i</i>, how can you determine the distance?  One way would
be to create an array with the new coordinates and find its min and max value.
Suppose you did that with sorting, and then looking at the first and last elements.  
Then determining the distance would be <i>O(n log(n))</i> (where <i>n</i> is <b>coordinates.size()</b>).  Since there are <i>n+1</i>
values of <i>i</i>, solving the problem in this way would be <i>O(n<sup>2</sup> log(n))</i>.
<p>
Instead, you can determine the min and max values by running through the new coordinates
array and storing the max/min while you run through it.  That is <i>O(n)</i>, which would
solve the problem in <i>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</i>.
<p>
You can do better.  Think about it -- the minimum value is going to either be
the first value, or the value of the smallest cat that jumped left (if any cats jumped
left).   The maximum value is either going to be the last value, or the value of
the greatest cat that jumped right (if any cats jumped right).  Those are the only 
values that you need to look at.
<p>
Let's look at example 0 to be sure we understand.  The original <b>coordinates</b>
vector is { -3, 0, 1 }.  When we sort it, it doesn't change.  
<UL>
<LI> Suppose <i>i=0</i>,
and the cat jumping is LLL.  Then the minimum value is going to be the value of cat
0 (-6), or the value of the smallest cat that jumped left (which happens to be cat 0): -6.
The maximum value is going to be the value of cat 2 (-2), or the value of the largest
cat that jumped right.  There is no such cat, so the minimum is -6 and the maximum is -2, making the difference 4.
<p>
<LI> Suppose <i>i=1</i>, and the cat jumping is RLL.
Then the minimum value is going to be the value of cat
0 (0), or the value of the smallest cat that jumped left (cat 1: -3).  Thus the 
minimum is -3.  The maximum value is going to be the value of cat 2 (-2), or the value of the largest
cat that jumped right (cat 0: 0).  Thus, the maximum is 0 and the difference is 3.

<p>
<LI> Suppose <i>i=2</i>, and the cat jumping is RRL.
Then the minimum value is going to be the value of cat
0 (0), or the value of the smallest cat that jumped left (cat 2: -2).  Thus the 
minimum is -2.  The maximum value is going to be the value of cat 2 (-2), or the value of the largest
cat that jumped right (cat 1: 3).  Thus, the maximum is 3 and the difference is 5.

<p>
<LI> Finally, suppose <i>i=3</i>, and the cat jumping is RRR.
Then the minimum value is going to be the value of cat
0 (0), or the value of the smallest cat that jumped left (no such cat).  Thus the 
minimum is 0.  The maximum value is going to be the value of cat 2 (4), or the value of the largest
cat that jumped right (cat 2: 4).  Thus, the maximum is 4 and the difference is 0.
</UL>

This determination is <i>O(1)</i>, which means that you solve the problem in linear time.
That's much better than the others.
<p>
Now, for the purposes of Topcoder, <i>n</i> has a maximum value of 50, so any algorithm
will work in practice.  However, this is a good exercise for you to figure out the
best algorithm and program it up.
