<h3>Question 1:</h3> 
a, d, e and f are all valid binary search trees.  b is not since
10 is 4's left child and is greater than 4, and c is not for the same
reason.

<h3>Question 2:</h3> a is an AVL tree because it is completely balanced.
e is also an AVL tree.  b and c are not because they are not binary 
search trees.  d and f are both imbalanced around the root node.

<h3>Question 3:</h3> c is the only heap.  It is a complete tree
where each node is less than its children.  B looks like a heap 
since each node is less than its children, but it is not a complete
tree (or even complete down to the last level).  F also looks like
a heap where each node is greater than its children, but it too is
not a complete tree down to the last level.

<h3>Question 4:</h3> 
You will insert 64 as the right child of 59, and then splay it to
the top.  This will require three rotations.

<h3>Question 5:</h3> 
    First, you insert 64 in the right place, which is as the right child
    of node 59:

<p>
Then you perform a zig-zag (double rotation) on node 64:
<p>

<p>
Now, node 64 is one level from the top.  Do a single rotation to make
it the root.  This is the answer:

<h3>Question 6</h3> 
    First, you insert 99 as the right child of 92.  
<p>
<IMG src="tree8a.gif">
<p>
Now, this creates
    an imbalance at node 44 due to a zig-zig.  Therefore, you perform
    a single rotation about node 76 to yield the answer:

<p>

<h3>Question 7</h3> 
    First, you insert 64 as the right child of 59.  
<p>
<IMG src="tree8c.gif">
<p>
Now, this creates
    an imbalance at node 44 due to a zig-zag.  Therefore, you perform
    a double rotation about node 59 to yield the answer:

<h3>Question 8:</h3> 

<UL>
<LI> (a) prints out exactly <i>n*n</i> lines.
<LI> (b) prints out exactly <i>n/5</i> lines.
<LI> (c) prints out exactly <i>log(n)</i> lines.
<LI> (d) prints out exactly <i>log(n)*(4n+2)</i> lines.
<LI> (e) prints out exactly <i>4n*n</i> lines.
<LI> (f) prints out exactly <i>n*n</i> lines.
</UL>

Therefore, only (c) is <i>O(log(n))</i>.

<h3>Question 9:</h3> Both b and c are <i>O(n)</i>.  Remember, if a function
is <i>O(f(n))</i> and <i>g(n) > f(n)</i>, then the function is also <i>O(g(n))</i>.

<h3>Question 10:</h3> b, c, and d are all <i>O(n*log(n))</i>.
<h3>Question 11:</h3> All the functions are <i>O(n*n)</i>.
<h3>Question 12:</h3> Only b is <i>Theta(n)</i>.
<h3>Question 13:</h3> a, e and f are <i>Omega(n*n)</i>.
<h3>Question 14:</h3> 
There are four steps to writing this code:
<UL>
<LI> Allocating storage for a new node.
<LI> Initializing the new node.
<LI> Finding where the node goes.
<LI> Inserting it in the right place.
</UL>
Here's the code:
<pre>
void insert_node(Bstree *tree, char *key, Jval v)
{
  BstreeNode *newnode, *tmp;

  /* Allocating storage for a new node. */
  
  newnode = (BstreeNode *) malloc(sizeof(BstreeNode));
  
  /* Initializing the new node */

  newnode->key = key;   /* you don't have to strdup, but I didn't take off 
                           for it */
  newnode->val = v;     /* Not new_jval_v(v).  V is already a jval */
  newnode->left = NULL;
  newnode->right = NULL;

  /* If the tree is empty, make this node the root */

  if (tree->root == NULL) {
    tree->root = newnode;
    return;
  }

  /* Otherwise, find where it should go and insert it */

  tmp = tree->root;
  while(1) {
    if (strcmp(tmp->key, key) > 0) {
      if (tmp->left == NULL) {  
        tmp->left = newnode;
        return;
      } 
      tmp = tmp->left;
    } else {
      if (tmp->right == NULL) {  
        tmp->right = newnode;
        return;
      } 
      tmp = tmp->right;
    }
  }
}
</pre>
Note, you can't make <b>insert_node()</b> recursive, because it takes a 
<b>Bstree</b> as its argument, and not a <b>BstreeNode</b>.  A recursive
solution is possible by writing a recursive function called by 
<b>insert_node()</b>.  The <b>while()</b> loop is much easier.

</UL>
<h3>Question 15:</h3> 
<UL>
<LI> (a) does not work since <b>h</b> can be increased past the
end of the hash table.
<LI> (b) works just fine.
<LI> (c) isn't even close -- it compares the index to the key and then
         returns the table entry.
<LI> (d) is close, except it shouldn't test if ``(hash(table[j], tsize) == h)''.
         Instead, it should test if ``<b>table[j] == key</b>''.
</UL>
<h3>Question 16:</h3> Given these inputs, <b>h</b> eventually gets a 
    value of 10, and <b>table[10]</b> is unknown.  Therefore, the answer
    is p (undetermined).  We could be dumping core, or returning some
    number bigger than 10.
<h3>Question 17:</h3> This works fine, and returns -1.  The answer is q.
<h3>Question 18:</h3> <b>j</b> will started out as 8.  Since
     ``(j == key)'', it will return <b>table[j]</b>, which is 88.  The
      answer is n.
<h3>Question 19:</h3> Again, <b>j</b> will start out as 8.  
       <b>hash(table[8], tsize)</b> equals 8, as does <b>h</b>.  Therefore
        the procedure will return 8.  The answer is i.
