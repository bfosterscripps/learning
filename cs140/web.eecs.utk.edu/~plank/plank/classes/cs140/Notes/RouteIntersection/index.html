First, give the problem some thought, and see how you do.  If you are lost
after 5 minutes or so, or don't know how to get started, then read on.
<hr>
The difficulty with this problem is dealing with the fact that you have
potentially 1,000,000,000 dimensions to keep track of, and that seems daunting.
However, let's think of the structure of a simple solution:
<p>
<UL>
<LI> Somehow keep track of your current point, and all of your previous points.  
<LI> Start with your current point being the origin.
<LI> At each point, check to see if that point has been seen already.
If so, return "NOT VALID".  
<LI> Otherwise, update your previous points to include the current point.
<LI> And update the current point to be the next point.
</uL>

You'd probably like to keep track of the current point with a vector
of integers, one for each dimension.  However, with 1,000,000,000 dimensions,
that's too big.  Instead, you can keep track of the current point with a
map whose keys and vals are both integers.  Any entry in the map will have its
key be the dimension and the val be the value of the point in that dimension.
Any dimension not in the map will have a value of zero.  Thus, the origin
can be represented with an empty map.  It can also be represented by any
number of entries whose vals are zero.  
<p>
Start by putting such a map into the RouteIntersection class, and write the
code that prints out the points on each iteration.  When you print a point, 
just print the non-zero values in the form "[dimension,value]".  
For example, Example 1 will go through the
following points:

<pre>
""              -- I.e. point (0,0)
"[1,1]"         -- I.e. point (1,0)
"[1,1][2,1]"    -- I.e. point (1,1)
"[2,1]"         -- I.e. point (0,1)
""
</pre>

Example 2 will go through:

<pre>
""                -- I.e. point (0,0,0)
"[1,1]"           -- I.e. point (1,0,0)
"[1,1][2,1]"      -- I.e. point (1,1,0)
"[1,1][2,1][3,1]" -- I.e. point (1,1,1)
"[2,1][3,1]"      -- I.e. point (0,1,1)
"[3,1]"           -- I.e. point (0,0,1)
</pre>


Now, instead of printing those points to standard output, use a stringstream
to turn them into strings.  Each string represents a unique point, so you can
keep a set of strings to represent the previous points, and you can use <b>find()</b>
to look up the current point as a string.
<p>
So, now your program should have the following structure:
<p>
<UL>
<LI> Represent the current point with a map that holds dimensions as keys, and
values as vals.  It starts out empty, as the current point is the origin.
<LI> Now, turn the current point into a string.  Look it up in the set.  If
you find it, return "NOT VALID".
<LI> Otherwise, insert it into the set, and then update the current point, and repeat.
<LI> If you process all the moves, you can return "VALID."
</UL>

It is ok to have points in the map whose values are zero -- simply ignore them.
It is easier to program it that way.
For example, in Example 1 above, when you reach point (0,1), your map will have
two values in it: [0,0] and [1,1].  However, when you print the point (or turn it
into a string), you will ignore the [0,0] value.  You may be tempted to remove it from
the map, but it is much easier to simply keep it there with a value of zero.

When I first did this one, in July, 2010, it took me 6 minutes for 230 points.
<p>
My second time, in September, 2010, took less time for 240 points!
<p>
When I did it the third time, for class prep in March, 2012, 
it took me 12 minutes, as I made a mistake generating the string and had to submit twice.  
Only 160 points or so...
