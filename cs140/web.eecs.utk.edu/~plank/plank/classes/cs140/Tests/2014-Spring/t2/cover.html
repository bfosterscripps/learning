If you are studying for future exams using this exam, I highly recommend
printing everything, and doing the exam timed with no study guides.  That's
the best preparation for duplicating your mental and emotional state during
the exam.

This was a challenging exam, no doubt because of the high number of 
multiple choice questions.  Unfortunately for y'all, that's an artifact of
having such high enrollments.
