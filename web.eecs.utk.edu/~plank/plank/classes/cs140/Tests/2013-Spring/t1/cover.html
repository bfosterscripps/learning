<h3>Scores</h3>

I designed this test as follows: Questions 1 - 4 were straight from class
and the lecture notes.  This is material that a diligent student would
study and be prepared to answer on an exam.  Question 5 was the topcoder-like
programming question, and it was a really easy one that tests your ability
to run through a loop and compare characters.  Question 6 was hard by
design.  Its intent was to test your familiarity with iterators and
pointers, which have been the subject of many lectures.  
<p>
I talked about
Question 6 in class.  A student wrote me a well-worded email explaining
why he thought the question was not fair, and he made some good points
for which I am to blame.  To wit, I should have stated my intentions for
you to focus on the iterators and vectors and not waste your time looking
for typos or other things that would cause compiler errors.  I should
have given you a strategy for solving this problem, so that you didn't
pour over 18 test cases in detail, but instead looked for trends.  
I apologized
for that in class, and apologize here.  That said, I went over the strategy
for solving the problem in class, and it's in the answers too -- please see the grading guide for 
more analysis of this question.
<p>
Here's my view of letter grades for this test.  The A student, in my 
opinion, would get the following scores for each question: 9, 8, 9, 9, 7, 5.
That's where I set the A mark.  The rest of the letter grades are as
follows:

<UL>
<LI> 58 and above: A+ -- a truly superlative job!
<LI> 47 - 58: A
<LI> 37 - 47: B
<LI> 27 - 47: C
<LI> 23 - 27: D
<LI> Below 23: F

Please see <a href=http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~plank/plank/classes/cs302/final_grades.html>My final grading guide for CS302</a> for description of
how the midterm affects the final grade.  In particular, with this midterm,
I will consider the top grade to be 58 (so those four students will 
have more than 100% on the exam).
