<h1> CS140 -- Midterm Exam: Answers</h1>

<h3>Questions 1-3</h3>
The output of this code is: (try it out -- in <a href="q1-3.c"><b>q1-3.c</b></a>)
<pre>
UNIX> q1-3
2 10
12 0xa
2 10
UNIX>
</pre>
Therefore the answers are:
<UL>
<LI> <b>Question 1</b>: <i>c</i>
<LI> <b>Question 2</b>: <i>i</i>
<LI> <b>Question 3</b>: <i>c</i>
</UL>
Many of you said that the last line was "12 6".  This would only happen if
<b>i</b> and <b>j</b> in <b>main()</b> were modified by the call
to <b>a()</b>.  However, in C, variables are passed <i>by value</i>, which 
means that <b>i</b> and <b>j</b> in the procedure <b>a()</b> are copies
of <b>main()</b>'s <b>i</b> and <b>j</b>.  This means that the "j -= 4"
line doesn't do anything.  True.  I was just testing to see if you 
knew this basic truth about parameter passing in C.
<hr>
<h3>Question 4</h3>
This one simply reverses <b>s1</b> and prints it out:
(try it out -- in <a href="q4.c"><b>q4.c</b></a>)
<pre>
UNIX> q4
!xiS miH eviG
UNIX>
</pre>
Therefore, the answer is <i>b</i>.

<hr>
<h3>Questions 5-6</h3>

<b>Revstring</b> reverses the input string, and then returns a pointer
to it.  Therefore, after the line ``<b>s = revstring(s1)</b>,'' both
<b>s</b> and <b>s1</b> point to the same piece of memory, which is
the string ``<b>!xiS miH eviG</b>.''  After the <b>strcpy()</b>,
this piece of memory becomes ``<b>Jim</b>'', and then after the 
call to <b>revstring</b> it becomes ``<b>miJ</b>''.  Therefore, 
both <b>s1</b> and <b>s</b> point to the string ``<b>miJ</b>''.
Thus, the output to the program is: 
(try it out -- in <a href="q5.c"><b>q5.c</b></a>)
<pre>
UNIX> q5
miJ
miJ
UNIX>
</pre>
So the answer to question 5 is <i>d</i>, and the answer to
question 6 is <i>d</i>.

<hr>
<h3>Question 7</h3>

No memory is ever allocated for <b>s</b>.  Therefore, the 
<b>strcpy()</b> statement is going to try to copy the string
``<b>Jim</b>'' into an unknown memory location.  This means anything
could happen -- segmentation violation (which is the most likely),
bus error, or something else.  Therefore, the answer is <i>h</i>,
although <i>j</i> is almost as good of an answer.
When I tried it out, I got differing results on different machines.
On <b>cetus1a</b>, it printed out ``<b>Jim</b>'' as if there
were actually memory allocated for <b>s</b>.  On <b>cobra</b>
(a Free-BSD-based pentium), I got a bus error.

<hr>
<h3>Question 8</h3>

This program adds each word of standard input weighed by 
which word number it is on that line.  So, on the first line
of this input, <b>total</b> is 1*1 + 2*2 + 3*3 = 14.
On the second line, <b>total</b> is increased by 1*4 + 2+5.
Therefore, <b>total</b> is 14+14 = 28.  The answer is <i>g</i>.
<pre>
UNIX> q8-11
1 2 3
  4 5
< CNTL-D >
<b>28</b>
UNIX>
</pre>

<hr>
<h3>Question 9</h3>

When the program hits the word ``<b>Jim</b>,'' the <b>sscanf()</b> 
statement will return 0.  Therefore, it will print 
``<b>Line 2 field 1</b>'' and exit:
<pre>
UNIX> q8-11
1 2 3
0 Jim Plank
<b>Line 2 field 1</b>
UNIX>
</pre>
The answer is <i>l</i>.

<hr>
<h3>Question 10</h3>
There's nothing special about the '#' character -- this is the fields
library, not <b>token.c</b>.  Therefore, it will print
``<b>Line 2 field 0</b>'' when it hits the '#' character, and exit:
<pre>
UNIX> q8-11
1 2 3
# 0 Jim Plank
<b>Line 2 field 0</b>
UNIX> 
</pre>
The answer is <i>k</i>.

<hr>
<h3>Question 11</h3>

The blank line does nothing here -- the <b>for()</b> statement
is skipped since <b>is->NF == 0</b>, and the next line of input
is processed.  Therefore, <b>total</b> is 1*1 + 2*2 + 3*3 + 1*4 + 1*0
+ 2*2 = 22.  The answer is <i>e</i>.
<pre>
UNIX> q8-11
1 2 3

<h3>Question 12</h3>

There is only one right answer here: <i>b</i>.  Answers
<i>a, d</i> and <i>e</i> return pointers to memory that goes
away when <b>make_new_person()</b> exits, and therefore 
are incorrect.  Answer <i>c</i> will not compile -- you cannot
use an ampersand in the left-hand side of a C expression.

<hr>
<h3>Question 13</h3>

There are two right answers here: <i>c</i> and <i>e</i>, which 
both do the same thing, although <i>c</i> is the better way since
it is easier to read.  Answers <i>a</i> and <i>d</i> both
will not compile.  Answer <i>b</i> is wrong because you need to
allocate storage for a copy of the names.  Otherwise, the
<b>firstname</b> field for each <b>Person</b> will point to the 
same string (same with the <b>lastname</b> field).
Finally, both <i>f</i> and <i>g</i> need to allocate storage in
order to perform the <b>strcpy()</b>.  Thier problem is just
like in Question 7.

<hr>
<h3>Question 14</h3>

There are two right answers here: <i>c</i> and <i>g</i>.
Answers <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> set the age to a pointer -- they 
will give compiler warnings and the age will be garbage.  
Answer <i>d</i> is half right -- the age will be fine, but 
you do not need to call <b>strdup()</b> and doing so will give
your program a memory leak.  Answer <i>e</i> won't compile, 
and answer <i>f</i> will probably dump core, since you need
to pass it the address of <b>p->age</b>.  Finally, answer
<i>h</i> will probably compile and run, but like answers
<i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, they set <b>p->age</b> to be a pointer
and not an integer.


<hr>
<h3>Question 15</h3>

This is very straightforward:
(In <a href="q15.c"><b>q15.c</b></a>):

<pre>
main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  int i;
  int l;

  for (i = 1; i < argc; i++) {
    l = strlen(argv[i]);   
    printf("%c\n", argv[i][l-1]);
  }
}
</pre>
<hr>
<h3>Question 16</h3>

You need to allocate an array of <b>n</b> (char *)'s.  Then read in 
the first <b>n</b> lines of standard input, and <b>strdup()</b> them
into the array.  If standard input has fewer than <b>n</b> lines, you 
adjust <b>n</b> to be the number of lines in standard input.  Then
you traverse thea array backwards, calling <b>fprintf()</b> to put
the lines into the output file.  
<p>
There are three places you need to error check: the number of arguments,
<b>n</b> (it should be a number greater than zero), and whether you
can open the file for writing.  Note, in my solution, I used <b>atoi()</b>
and then tested to see if <b>n</b> was less than or equal to zero.  If
the first argument is not a number, <b>atoi()</b> returns zero, so that
error condition is caught.  If you use <b>sscanf()</b> you'll have to 
test the return value to see if the argument was a number.  Alternatively,
you can set <b>n</b> to zero before the <b>sscanf()</b>, and then if the
argument is not a number, <b>n</b>'s value will be unchanged, and the 
error will be flagged without testing the return value.
<p>
You also can use <b>gets()</b> to read standard input, rather than
the fields library.
<p>
Here is a correct answer.  
(In <a href="q16.c"><b>q16.c</b></a>):
<pre>
#include < stdio.h >
#include < string.h >
#include "fields.h"

main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    /* Make variable declarations */

    FILE *f;       /* For reading in the file */
    int n;         /* Number of lines */
    char **array;  /* Array for holding n lines */
    IS is;         /* Inputstruct for reading input */
    int i;         /* Induction variable for the for loops */

    /* Make sure you have the right number of command line arguments */

    if (argc != 3) {
      fprintf(stderr, "usage: revn n filename\n");
      exit(1);
    }

    /* Make sure n is a legal value */

    n = atoi(argv[1]);  /* You could also do a sscanf here */
    if (n <= 0) {
      fprintf(stderr, "Bad value of n\n");
      exit(1);
    }

   /* Open the file, allocate your array to hold the lines */

    f = fopen(argv[2], "w");
    if (f == NULL) { perror(argv[2]); exit(1); }
    array = (char **) malloc(sizeof(char *) * n);
   
   /* Read in the first n lines (or the entire file if it has < n lines */
   /* There are other ways to do this, but this is pretty clean */

    is = new_inputstruct(NULL);
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      if (get_line(is) < 0) {
        n = i;
      } else {
        array[i] = strdup(is->text1);
      }
    }

   /* Print out the first n lines to the file in reverse order */

   for (i = n-1; i >= 0; i--) {
     fprintf(f, "%s", array[i]);
   }

}
</pre>
