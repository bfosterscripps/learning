<hr><h3>Question 5: 10 points</h3>

Behold the following B-Tree, where <I>M</i> = 4:

<p>

<h3>Part 1</h3>

Specify the values that are held in the three interior nodes.  Specify
them as "Root", "Left-Child", and "Right-Child".


<h3>Part 2</h3>

Draw the tree that results when 15 is inserted into the tree.
Include in your drawing the values in both the interior and exterior
nodes.


<hr><h3>Question 6 -- 15 points</h3>

Behold a <b>typedef</b> for a binary tree node:

<p>
<table border=3 cellpadding=4>
<td><pre>
typedef struct btreenode {
  Jval key;
  struct btreenode *left;
  struct btreenode *right;
} BTreeNode;
</pre>
</td>
</table>
<p>
Your job is to write a procedure:
<pre>
   int is_bstree(BTreeNode *root, double *min, double *max); 
</pre>
<p>
<b>Is_bstree()</b> assumes that it is passed the root of a binary tree,
and that the keys are <b>double</b>s.
It returns 1 if the tree is a valid binary search tree, and 0 otherwise.
The binary search tree should not have duplicate keys.
It also returns the minimum and maximum keys in the tree through the
arguments <b>min</b> and <b>max</b>.
