A straightforward exam.  Question one was straight from the lecture notes.
Question two was of a type you should have expected -- it had no tricks.
Question three had some tricky parts.  Question 4 was straightforward stack/queue
code, and question 5 was easier than many of your lab programs.  I expected good
grades, and was greeted by many excellent exams.
