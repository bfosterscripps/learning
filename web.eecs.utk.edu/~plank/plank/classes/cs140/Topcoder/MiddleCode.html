<hr>

The simplest solution is to simply execute the algorithm as written.  You'll start with a string
<b>s</b> and an empty string <b>t</b>, and you'll find the character in <b>s</b> that goes into
<b>t</b> and append it to <b>t</b>.  Then you delete the character from <b>s</b>.
<p>
For example, when <b>s</b> is "word", you have the following:

<p><center><table border=3>
<tr>
<td align=center><b>s</b></td>
<td align=center><b>t</b></td>
<td align=center>New <b>s</b></td>
<td align=center>New <b>t</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center>"word"</td>
<td align=center>""</td>
<td align=center>"wrd"</td>
<td align=center>"o"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center>"wrd"</td>
<td align=center>"o"</td>
<td align=center>"wd"</td>
<td align=center>"or"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center>"wd"</td>
<td align=center>"or"</td>
<td align=center>"w"</td>
<td align=center>"ord"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center>"w"</td>
<td align=center>"ord"</td>
<td align=center>""</td>
<td align=center>"ordw"</td>
</tr>
</table></center><p>

The only subtlety is how to delete the character from <b>s</b>.  One way is to use the 
<b>substr()</b> method to create <b>s</b> from the substrings before the letter that you're
deleting and after the letter that you're deleting.  So, for example, when you delete the 'o'
from "word", you do it by creating the substrings "w" and "rd", and concatenating them.
<p>
Here's some C++ code that does the trick (i and j are ints).

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
  while (s.size() &gt; 0) {
    i = s.size();
    j = i/2;

    /* If i is odd, then j is the index of the character that we're deleting, so
       we do nothing in that case.

       If i is even, then the two indices that we need to compare are j and j-1.
       We want to set j to be the character that is the smaller of these two.
       The statement below does this.  

       When we're done with the statement, we want to put the character in s[j]
       onto the back of t, and then delete it. */


    if (i % 2 == 0 && s[j-1] &lt; s[j]) j--;
      
    printf("S = %s.  T = %s.  i = %d.  j = %d.\n", s.c_str(), t.c_str(), i, j);

    t.push_back(s[j]);
    s = s.substr(0, j) + s.substr(j+1);
  }
  printf("T = %s\n", t.c_str());
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Here's what it prints out on examples 0 and 3:
<p><center><table border=3>
<td valign=top>
<u>Example 0:</u><pre>
S = word.  T = .  i = 4.  j = 1.
S = wrd.  T = o.  i = 3.  j = 1.
S = wd.  T = or.  i = 2.  j = 1.
S = w.  T = ord.  i = 1.  j = 0.
T = ordw</pre>
</td>
<td valign=top>
<u>Example 3:</u><pre>
S = shjegr.  T = .  i = 6.  j = 3.
S = shjgr.  T = e.  i = 5.  j = 2.
S = shgr.  T = ej.  i = 4.  j = 2.
S = shr.  T = ejg.  i = 3.  j = 1.
S = sr.  T = ejgh.  i = 2.  j = 1.
S = s.  T = ejghr.  i = 1.  j = 0.
T = ejghrs</pre>
</td>
</table></center><p>

That works fine and solves the problem for Topcoder.  However, I want you to think
about its running time.  Suppose that <b>s</b> originally has <i>n</i> characters.
Then the <b>while()</b> loop will run <i>n</i> times, and each time, it is creating
<b>s</b> from scratch.  At iteration <i>i</i>, the size of <i>s</i> is <i>n-i</i>, 
which means that the amount of work that we're doing to create <i>s</i> overall
is <i>n-1</i>, <i>n-2</i>, <i>n-3</i>, ..., 1.  This is the sum of one through <i>n-1</i>,
which is equal to <i>n(n-1)/2</i>, or 1/2(n<sup>2</sup> - n)</i>.  We'll learn how
to characterize this later in the semester, but let's think about it for 
various values of <i>n</i>:

<p><center><table border=3>
<tr>
<td align=center><i>n</i></td>
<td align=center><i>n(n-1)/2</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center>10</td>
<td align=center>45</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center>100</td>
<td align=center>4,950</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center>1000</td>
<td align=center>499,500</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center>10000</td>
<td align=center>49,995,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align=center>100000</td>
<td align=center>4,999,950,000</td>
</tr>
</table>

That's growing pretty quickly.  I gave my program a word that has 10,000 characters,
(and took out the print statements), and it took 0.6 seconds.  On a word with 100,000
characters, it took a minute and forty seconds!  That's too slow!

<p>
To fix this, let's try not to delete the character in <b>s</b>, or remake <b>s</b>.  Instead, 
let's do the following.  The first time we look at <b>s</b>, if it's odd, we'll go ahead
and do what we did before.  Now, <b>s</b> is even.  Let's set <b>i</b> to <b>s.size()/2</b>,
and <b>j</b> to <b>i-1</b>.  Those are the characters to test.  Let's suppose that <b>s[j]</b>
is less than <b>s[i]</b> -- we'll add <b>s[j]</b> to <b>t</b>, and then <b>s[i]</b>.  
Otherwise, we'll add <b>s[i]</b> to <b>t</b>, and then <b>s[j]</b>.  
And then we'll decrement <b>j</b> and increment <b>i</b>.  If we keep doing that until <b>j</b> 
is -1, we'll have constructed <b>t</b> properly, and we haven't had to mess around with 
creating a new <b>s</b> every time.  
<p>
Here's the relevant snippet of code:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
  t = "";
  i = s.size()/2;
  j = i-1;
  while (j != -1) {
    if (s[j] &lt; s[i]) {
      t.push_back(s[j]);
      t.push_back(s[i]);
    } else {
      t.push_back(s[i]);
      t.push_back(s[j]);
    }
    i++;
    j--;
  }
</pre></td></table></center><p>

When I run it on a 100,000 character string, it takes  0.02 seconds.  That's a <i>huge</i>
difference!  We're going to see things like this time and time again in this class.
It's called "algorithm analysis," and it's important, because it lets you predict how
quickly your program will run, and figure out how to make it much faster.
