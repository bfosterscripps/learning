<h3> Question 14<br>
CS140 Final Exam: May 10, 1999</h3>

The following code is a typedef for a binary search tree node:
<pre>
typedef struct bstreenode {
  char *key;
  Jval val;
  struct bstreenode *left;
  struct bstreenode *right;
} BstreeNode;
</pre>

And the following is the typedef for a binary search tree:

<pre>
typedef struct {
  BstreeNode *root;
} Bstree;
</pre>

Suppose keys are character strings.  Write code for:
<pre>
void insert_node(Bstree *tree, char *key, Jval v);
</pre>
This inserts a new node into the tree with the given key and value.
You may assume that there are no nodes in the tree with the given key.
<p>
Do your answer on the answer sheet.
