<h3>String Basics</h3>

Strings are a fundamental class supported by C++ to do text processing.
Although most installations won't require you to include &lt;string&gt; for your
programs to compile, it can't hurt, so it's not a bad habit to acquire.
<p>
Strings in C++ are very natural, so you can often write programs with them
without thinking about it too much.  For example, the following program 
(<b><a href="string-basic.cpp">string-basic.cpp</a></b>)
illustrates many functionalities with strings:

<p>
<UL>
<LI> Assigning them from string literals.
<LI> Using <b>size()</b> to determine their size.
<LI> Changing their contents by treating them like an array.
<LI> Testing equality using "=="
<LI> Comparing them using "<", etc.
<LI> Concatenating them with "+".
</UL>

<p>I'm assuming that all of this is review from CS102.

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
using namespace std;

main()
{
  string a, b, c;
  int i;

  a = "LIGHTNING";
  b = "Lightning";
  c = "Strikes";

  cout &lt;&lt; "a: " &lt;&lt; a &lt;&lt; " -- " &lt;&lt; a.size() &lt;&lt; " characters." &lt;&lt; endl;
  cout &lt;&lt; "b: " &lt;&lt; b &lt;&lt; " -- " &lt;&lt; b.size() &lt;&lt; " characters." &lt;&lt; endl;
  cout &lt;&lt; "c: " &lt;&lt; c &lt;&lt; " -- " &lt;&lt; c.size() &lt;&lt; " characters." &lt;&lt; endl;
  cout &lt;&lt; endl;

  printf("Changing all but the first character of a to lower case:\n\n");

  for (i = 1; i &lt; a.size(); i++) a[i] += ('a' - 'A');
  cout &lt;&lt; "Changed a to: " &lt;&lt; a &lt;&lt; endl &lt;&lt; endl;

  printf("Testing equality: (a == b): %d.  (a == c): %d.  (b == c): %d\n", (a == b), (a == c), (b == c));

  printf("Comparison:       (a &gt;= b): %d.  (a &gt;= c): %d.  (b &gt;= c): %d\n", (a &gt;= b), (a &gt;= c), (b &gt;= c));
  printf("Comparison:       (a &lt;= b): %d.  (a &lt;= c): %d.  (b &lt;= c): %d\n", (a &lt;= b), (a &lt;= c), (b &lt;= c));
  printf("Comparison:       (a &lt;  b): %d.  (a &lt;  c): %d.  (b &lt;  c): %d\n", (a &lt;  b), (a &lt;  c), (b &lt;  c));
  printf("Comparison:       (a &gt;  b): %d.  (a &gt;  c): %d.  (b &gt;  c): %d\n", (a &gt;  b), (a &gt;  c), (b &gt;  c));
  cout &lt;&lt; endl;

  a = b + c;
  cout &lt;&lt; "a = b + c: a is now: " &lt;&lt; a &lt;&lt; endl;

  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Nothing surprising happens when we run this:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>g++ -o string-basic string-basic.cpp</b></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>string-basic</b></font>
a: LIGHTNING -- 9 characters.
b: Lightning -- 9 characters.
c: Strikes -- 7 characters.

Changing all but the first character of a to lower case:

Changed a to: Lightning

Testing equality: (a == b): 1.  (a == c): 0.  (b == c): 0
Comparison:       (a >= b): 1.  (a >= c): 0.  (b >= c): 0
Comparison:       (a <= b): 1.  (a <= c): 1.  (b <= c): 1
Comparison:       (a <  b): 0.  (a <  c): 1.  (b <  c): 1
Comparison:       (a >  b): 0.  (a >  c): 0.  (b >  c): 0

a = b + c: a is now: LightningStrikes
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

Those last three functionalities (comparison and concatenation) exploit a
feature of C++ that you may learn more about someday.  It's called "operator
overloading," which allows you to redefine basic operators in the language
to work on user-defined objects.  In this case, '==', '<=', '>=', '<', '>'
and '+' have all been defined to work on strings.   It's pretty convenient
in this case, but you should know that I'm not a fan of operator overloading
in general.  Put that in the back of your mind.

<hr>
<h2>Getline()</h2>

The procedure <b>getline(cin, s)</b> 
reads a line of input from standard input and puts it into the string <b>s</b>. 
Spaces are preserved.   Later, we will use <b>getline()</b> and stringstreams to 
process input.  However, here, we simply read lines of standard input with 
<b>getline()</b> (this in <b><a href="getline.cpp">getline.cpp</a></b>):

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

main()
{
  string s;
  int ln, len;

  ln = 0;
  while (getline(cin, s)) {
    ln++;
    len = s.size();
    printf("Line %2d - Size: %3d - %s\n", ln, len, s.c_str());
  }
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Running it, we see that it works as promised:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>g++ -o getline getline.cpp</b></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>cat input.txt</b></font>

<h3>Vector Basics</h3>

Vectors are the simplest part of the Standard Template Library (STL).  There's
a lot of linguistic hocus pocus that has to go on for the STL to work as it does.
We won't concern ourselves with that in this class, but we will teach you how to 
make use of the library effectively.   Vectors are a general-purpose array class.
They differ from C arrays in many important ways, and they are easier to use.
To use a vector, you include <b>vector</b>, and then you declare a vector as 
follows:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
vector &lt;<b>TYPE</b>&gt; <b>variable-name(s)</b>
</pre></td></table></center><p>

The <b>TYPE</b> can be a basic type like <b>int</b> or <b>double</b>, or it can 
be more complex, like a C++ class or even another vector.  You can declare a vector
as starting with a certain number of elements, or you can declare it to be empty.
In either case, you can dynamically modify the vector's size with the <b>resize()</b>
method.  You can use the <b>size()</b> method to get the vector's current size.
<p>
A very simple example program is in 
<b><a href="vec1.cpp">vec1.cpp</a></b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

main()
{
  vector &lt;int&gt; v1;
  vector &lt;double&gt; v2(10);
  int i;

  printf("V1's size: %ld.  V2's size: %ld\n", v1.size(), v2.size());
     <font color=darkblue> // It is unfortunate that size() returns a "long", so you must use "%ld".
      // We'll talk about it in class</font>

  v1.resize(5);
  v2.resize(8);

  printf("V1's size: %ld.  V2's size: %ld\n", v1.size(), v2.size());

  for (i = 0; i &lt; v1.size(); i++) v1[i] = 10 + i;
  for (i = 0; i &lt; v2.size(); i++) v2[i] = 20.3 + i;

  printf("V1:"); for (i = 0; i &lt; v1.size(); i++) printf(" %d", v1[i]); printf("\n");
  printf("V2:"); for (i = 0; i &lt; v2.size(); i++) printf(" %.1lf", v2[i]); printf("\n");
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

This program declares an empty integer vector <b>v1</b> and a ten-element
double vector <b>v2</b>, and prints their sizes.  It then resizes the 
vectors to five and eight and prints their sizes again.  It then initializes
the elements of <b>v1</b> and <b>v2</b> in two <b>for</b> loops and prints out the
two vectors.  Straightforward stuff:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>vec1</b></font>
V1's size: 0.  V2's size: 10
V1's size: 5.  V2's size: 8
V1: 10 11 12 13 14
V2: 20.3 21.3 22.3 23.3 24.3 25.3 26.3 27.3
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

One note -- when you print a <b>size()</b> with <b>printf()</b>, you need to 
specify "%ld" instead of "%d".  This is because sizes are 64-bit quantities.  
If you don't do it, you will
get a compiler warning.

<p>
When you create array elements, default values are placed in there.  For example,
string arrays start with default empty strings.  Numerical values should be zero, but
frankly I'd be leery of trusting that.  You can specify what the default values should
be as a second parameter to the <b>resize()</b> method.
<p>
Take a careful look at 
<b><a href="vec2.cpp">vec2.cpp</a></b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

main()
{
  vector &lt;int&gt; v1;
  vector &lt;double&gt; v2;
  int i;

  v1.resize(5, 22);
  v1.resize(8, 33);

  for (i = 0; i &lt; v1.size(); i++) printf(" %d", v1[i]); 
  printf("\n");

  v1.resize(6);
  for (i = 0; i &lt; v1.size(); i++) printf(" %d", v1[i]); 
  printf("\n");

  v1.resize(10, 44);
  for (i = 0; i &lt; v1.size(); i++) printf(" %d", v1[i]); 
  printf("\n");

  v2.resize(10, drand48());
  printf("\n");
  for (i = 0; i &lt; v1.size(); i++) printf(" %4.2lf", v2[i]); 
  printf("\n");
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

We first resize <b>v1</b> to hold five elements that are 22, and then we
resize <b>v2</b> to hold eight elements with a default of 33.  This raises
a question -- will only the new elements be 33, or will all of them?  Look 
at the output:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>vec2</b></font>
 22 22 22 22 22 33 33 33
 22 22 22 22 22 33
 22 22 22 22 22 33 44 44 44 44

 0.40 0.40 0.40 0.40 0.40 0.40 0.40 0.40 0.40 0.40
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

Only the new ones are given values.  The third <b>resize()</b> removes two
elements, and then the fourth increases the size from 6 to 10, putting
the value of 44 into the new elements.
<p>
The last <b>resize()</b> changes <b>v2</b>'s size from 0 to ten, setting
<b>drand48()</b> as the default.  As you see above, that chooses one random 
value and puts it into every element.  Perhaps you thought it would put random
elements throughout <b>v2</b> -- that doesn't happen because <b>drand48()</b>
is only called once, and its one return value is what is passed to <b>resize()</b>.

<hr>
<h3>push_back(), reverse, tail</h3>

Two canonical vector programs are <b>reverse.cpp</b> and <b>mytail.cpp</b>.
The first is really simple -- it prints out the lines of standard input in 
reverse order.  You need a data struture like a vector to do this, because you 
can't print the first line of output until you've read the last line of input,
and you have to store all of those lines somewhere.  
<p>
Here's
<b><a href="reverse.cpp">reverse.cpp</a></b>

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

main()
{
  vector &lt;string&gt; lines;
  int i;
  string s;

  while (getline(cin, s)) lines.push_back(s);
  for (i = lines.size()-1; i &gt;= 0; i--) cout &lt;&lt; lines[i] &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

It makes use of the vector method <b>push_back()</b>, which appends an element to
a vector.  <b>push_back()</b> is guaranteed to run quickly, and it is much
more convenient than resizing the array.  
<p>
To show <b>reverse</b> running, I first call <b>cat -n</b> on <b>input.txt</b>.
That prints <b>input.txt</b> to the screen with line numbers.  The second command
uses a "pipe" -- which specifies to have standard output of one command be standard
input of another.  That turns out to be a very powerful feature of Unix -- one that
you will use frequently:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>cat -n input.txt</b></font>
     1	Give me a weapon of power, which no one else may hold,
     2	Defend the Gods with honor, To lead the BRAVE and BOLD
     3	
     4	    LIGHTNING STRIKES LIGHTNING STRIKES AGAIN
     5	    LIGHTNING STRIKES LIGHTNING STRIKES AGAIN
     6	
     7	Bequeathed to me by Odin, Molded by the Dwarfs
     8	MINE! This shimmering mallet, The Symbol of the Norse
     9	
    10	    LIGHTNING STRIKES LIGHTNING STRIKES AGAIN
    11	    LIGHTNING STRIKES LIGHTNING STRIKES AGAIN

    11	    LIGHTNING STRIKES LIGHTNING STRIKES AGAIN

     9	
     8	MINE! This shimmering mallet, The Symbol of the Norse

     1	Give me a weapon of power, which no one else may hold,
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>


The second program performs the same functionality as the <b>tail</b> command -- 
it prints out the last ten lines of standard input.  We can write a simple version
of <b>tail</b> that is like <b>reverse.cpp</b>.  It reads all of the lines into 
a vector and then prints out just the last ten.  It's in 
<b><a href="mytail1.cpp">mytail1.cpp</a></b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

main()
{
  vector &lt;string&gt; lines;
  int i;
  string s;

  while (getline(cin, s)) lines.push_back(s);
  i = lines.size()-10;
  if (i &lt; 0) i = 0;
  for ( ; i &lt; lines.size(); i++) cout &lt;&lt; lines[i] &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

We need the <b>if</b> statement to handle files that are smaller than 10 lines.
If we didn't have the <b>if</b> statement, <i>i</i> would be less than zero,
and our program would have a bug.  Hopefully that bug would be manifested by a
segmentation violation, but you never know.  Since we've put in that <b>if</b>
statement, there is no bug:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>cat -n input.txt | mytail1</b></font>
     2	Defend the Gods with honor, To lead the BRAVE and BOLD
     3	
     4	    LIGHTNING STRIKES LIGHTNING STRIKES AGAIN
     5	    LIGHTNING STRIKES LIGHTNING STRIKES AGAIN
     6	
     7	Bequeathed to me by Odin, Molded by the Dwarfs
     8	MINE! This shimmering mallet, The Symbol of the Norse

Defend the Gods with honor, To lead the BRAVE and BOLD

    LIGHTNING STRIKES LIGHTNING STRIKES AGAIN
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

I'll contend, though, that <b>mytail1.cpp</b> is not as good of a program
as it could be.  Why?  Consider
what happens if you call it on a file 1,000,000 lines.  You are storing all
1,000,000 lines, but you are only printing the last ten.  That's a big
waste of memory!
<p>
This problem is fixed in
<b><a href="mytail2.cpp">mytail2.cpp</a></b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

main()
{
  vector &lt;string&gt; lines;
  int i, ln;
  string s;

  ln = 0;
  while (getline(cin, s)) {
    if (ln &lt; 10) {
      lines.push_back(s);
    } else {
      lines[ln%10] = s;
    }    
    ln++;
  }
  i = ln-10;
  if (i &lt; 0) i = 0;
  for ( ; i &lt; ln; i++) cout &lt;&lt; lines[i%10] &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Once <b>lines</b> becomes ten elements long, we no longer call <b>push_back()</b>, but
instead replace the oldest element with <b>s</b>.  When reading is done, we have the
last ten lines, but not always starting at element 0.  To print them out, we need to 
find the array element for each of the last ten lines.  Consider line <b>l</b>.  If it
is in the array, it will be in element <b>l%10</b>.  Thus, if the file has <b>ln</b> total 
lines and <b>ln &gt; 10</b>, then we want to print out lines <b>ln-10</b> to <b>ln-1</b>.
The <b>for</b> loop that ends the program does just that.
<p>
<h3>Put this bug in the back of your head</h3>

I'll explain this in class.  I won't test you on this, but remember it, because it will
happen to you someday (I'll go over it again later as well).
<p>
<b><a href="mytail3.cpp">mytail3.cpp</a></b> is identical to 
<b><a href="mytail1.cpp">mytail1.cpp</a></b>, except the <b>for</b> loop is as follows:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
  for (i = (lines.size()-10 &lt; 0) ? 0 : lines.size()-10 ; i &lt; lines.size(); i++) {
    cout &lt;&lt; lines[i] &lt;&lt; endl;
  }
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Take a look at the following output:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>cat input.txt | mytail3</b></font>
Defend the Gods with honor, To lead the BRAVE and BOLD

    LIGHTNING STRIKES LIGHTNING STRIKES AGAIN
    LIGHTNING STRIKES LIGHTNING STRIKES AGAIN

Bequeathed to me by Odin, Molded by the Dwarfs
MINE! This shimmering mallet, The Symbol of the Norse

    LIGHTNING STRIKES LIGHTNING STRIKES AGAIN
    LIGHTNING STRIKES LIGHTNING STRIKES AGAIN
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>head -n 5 input.txt | mytail3</b></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

Do you see a problem?  Again, we'll go over this in class, because it is confusing.  And evil.
